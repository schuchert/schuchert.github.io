# Energy Practice: Blending Ritual Visualization, Qi Exercises, and Total Breath

Combining the subtle energy work from *Ritual: An Essential Grimoire*, foundational qi exercises from Rick Krause, and the clinically researched "total breath" from *The Healing Power of the Breath* by Drs. Richard P. Brown and Patricia L. Gerbarg, this practice offers a holistic approach to cultivating vitality, grounding, and spiritual clarity. Through intentional breathwork, visualization, and movement, you can harmonize body and mind, drawing on both ancient wisdom and modern science.

## The Practice Flow

### 1. Four-Part Breathing

Begin with a rhythmic, four-part breath to center yourself:

- **Inhale**
- **Pause**
- **Exhale**
- **Pause**

This breathing structure calms the mind and prepares the body for deeper energetic work, echoing techniques recommended for both subtle energy and breathwork practices.

### 2. Directional Energy Movement

With each breath cycle, guide your awareness and hands through a sequence aligned with the body's energy centers (Dan Tiens):

- **Palms at Upper Dan Tien:** Pull energy from above, visualizing white light entering.
- **Palms at Mid Dan Tien:** Let this white energy fill your center.
- **Palms to the Ground:** Push the energy down through your body, visualizing roots forming deep into the earth.
- **Palms Pulling from Below:** Draw green energy up from the earth’s core.
- **Palms at Mid Dan Tien:** Let this green energy fill your center.
- **Palms to Upper Dan Tien:** Visualize the green energy rising, sprouting leaves like a willow tree.

### 3. General Visualization

- **Inhale:** Picture white tendrils of energy descending from above, filling your midsection with qi.
- **Exhale:** Imagine this energy flowing downward, rooting you to the earth.
- **Inhale:** Draw green energy up from the earth, filling your center.
- **Exhale:** Visualize green energy rising through your body, sprouting like willow leaves from your crown and cascading back to the ground.

These visualizations are inspired by grounding and energy-cleansing rituals, emphasizing the importance of connecting with both celestial and terrestrial sources of energy.

### 4. Standing in Wu Chi

Adopt the Wu Chi stance—a relaxed, upright posture used in qigong and tai chi to cultivate stillness and readiness. Gentle shaking can be added to stimulate the lymphatic system and release tension, a practice known for its benefits in both qigong and modern movement therapies.

### 5. Gathering Qi from Above

- Raise your hands, palms facing the sky, and look upward.
- Visualize an infinitely bright white light above, representing a safe, limitless source of energy.
- As you inhale, slowly draw your hands down in front of your body, palms facing each other, visualizing white light entering your midsection.
- Pause, letting the light saturate your center.
- Exhale, pushing your palms down, visualizing energy flowing through your body and into the earth, forming strong, stable roots.

### 6. Drawing Qi from Below

- Bring your palms back to your midsection.
- Visualize pulling vibrant green energy from the earth’s core, drawing it up through your feet and legs to your center.
- Pause, allowing this green energy to fill your midsection.
- Exhale, raising your palms and visualizing the green energy rising through your body and out the crown of your head, blossoming like willow leaves.

## Integrating "Total Breath" from *The Healing Power of the Breath*

To deepen the benefits of this practice, incorporate "total breath"—a slow, rhythmic, and conscious breathing technique. Drs. Brown and Gerbarg recommend:

- **Slow, Coherent Breathing:** Aim for a breath cycle of about 10–12 seconds (five to six breaths per minute), or as slow as is comfortable for you. This aligns with the four-part breathing structure, where you inhale, pause, exhale, and pause again, each for an equal count.
- **Diaphragmatic Engagement:** Breathe deeply into your diaphragm, allowing your belly to rise on the inhale and fall on the exhale. This increases oxygenation and stimulates the vagus nerve, promoting relaxation and activating the parasympathetic nervous system.
- **Visualization and Intention:** As you practice total breath, pair each phase of the breath with the energy visualizations from the ritual and qi exercises, amplifying the effects of both.

**Benefits of Total Breath**

Research and clinical experience show that total breath can:

- Reduce anxiety and depression
- Improve sleep and resilience to stress
- Enhance concentration and emotional balance
- Support trauma recovery and overall vitality

> “Breathing practices activate communication pathways between the mind and the body, positively impacting the brain and calming the stress response.”

## Bringing It All Together

By blending total breath with the visualization and movement elements of this energy practice, you create a powerful, holistic routine. Each slow, intentional breath becomes a vehicle for both physiological and energetic transformation, grounding you in the present while opening pathways for healing and growth.

### Tips for Practice

- **Set an Intention:** Begin with a simple affirmation or intention for your practice.
- **Move Slowly:** Allow your breath and movement to guide each other.
- **Visualize Vividly:** The more clearly you picture the energy, the deeper the effect.
- **Practice Regularly:** Consistency is key for lasting benefits.

  * Exhale - white energy continues down your body into the ground, forming the roots of a willow
  * Inhale - green energy comes from the center of (mother) earth, filling your mid dan tien 
    with green energy
  * Exhale - green energy continues up your body, sprouting willow leaves out of your head like 
    a fountain, reaching the ground

* Stand in wu chi
  * Notes on Wu Chi
* Shake a bit
  * Movement is Medicine
  * Lymphatic system cleaning
* Raise your hands, palms facing the sky, and look up
* Gather qi from Father Sky / The Source / The Top of the Universe, from "Up - Yang"
  * Envision an infinitely bright white light from which you can draw energy freely and safely
* As you inhale
  * Move your hands slowly down your front, palms reflecting (center points facing, fingers and 
    thumbs facing each other)
  * Visualize tendrils of white light coming down from the source and into your mid dan tien
* Pause
  * Take a pause - up to as long as your inhale time
  * As you pause, allow the white light to file up your mid dan tien as it gets filled with 
    bright white qi
* As you exhale
  * Push your palms down, ultimately pointing your palms into the ground
  * Visualize the qi in your mid dan tien going through body, waist, hips, thighs, knees, calves,
    down through the 9 yang points in the feet (5 toes, balls of foot at the front, heal, 
    outside edge)
  * Visualize this energy forming roots of a tree where your body is the trunk
* As you inhale
  * Bring your palms back up to your mid dan tien
  * Visualize pulling green energy from mother earth - imagine the a huge green ball at the 
    center of the earth. That green ball of energy is the source of creation on the earth. 
  * As you draw your breath in, that green energy pulls from the center of the earth into your 
    bubbling well (the arch of your foot at its highest point approximately, if you push 
    on it you'll know)
  * That green energy travels up the ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hip, waist into your mid dan 
    tien
* Pause
  * As you pause, up to as long as you exhale, allow that green energy to fill your mid dan tien,
    which becomes a vivid, bright green
* As you exhale
  * Raise your palms, pushing the green energy, up to father sky
  * That green energy continues up through your chest, throat, into your jaw, teeth, skull, ears,
    and finally comes out like willow leaves that curl back to the ground
* Repeat this process, slowing it down
  * A 4 count for each part of the breath gives you just under 4 breaths a minute
  * As you practice, you will increase your capacity
  * Work your way up to 1 breath a minute, 15 second inhale, 15 second pause, 15 second exhale, 
    15 second pause - unless you do a lot of exercise and breath practice, this is stretch goal
  * But for most people, 3 seconds per part will give 5 breaths, which is coherent breathing
    * We are adding visualization to this (aka breath moving), so we are nearly doing total 
      breathing
    * If you add constricted, or Ujjayi breathing, then you are also doing total breathing 
      (Brown, Gerbarg)
    * There's a great deal of clinical research
    * One difference, they generally do 6 seconds in/out. But the ratio is 5 breaths per second
    * If you are taller than 6' 2", you might need to breath a bit slower
  * Include breathing into your diaphragm
    * Stimulates vagus nerve
    * Parasympathetic upregulating
