# Energy Practice: Blending Ritual Visualization, Qi Exercises, and Total Breath

Combining the subtle energy work from *Ritual: An Essential Grimoire*, foundational qi exercises from Rick Krause, and the clinically researched "total breath" from *The Healing Power of the Breath* by Drs. Richard P. Brown and Patricia L. Gerbarg, this practice offers a holistic approach to cultivating vitality, grounding, and spiritual clarity. Through intentional breathwork, visualization, and movement, you can harmonize body and mind, drawing on both ancient wisdom and modern science.

---

## Accessibility and Everyday Practice

This energy practice is designed to be accessible and practical; no prior experience, belief, or complex ritual is required. Its strength lies in regular, simple repetition. You can use this sequence as a daily reset, a grounding ritual, or a tool for emotional resilience at any time.

## The Practice Flow

### 1. Four-Part Breathing

Begin with a rhythmic, four-part breath to center yourself:

- **Inhale**
- **Pause**
- **Exhale**
- **Pause**

This breathing structure calms the mind and prepares the body for deeper energetic work, echoing techniques recommended for both subtle energy and breathwork practices.

### 2. Energy Movement & Visualization Sequence

Follow this integrated sequence, synchronizing breath, movement, and visualization:

1. **Inhale (Energy from Above):**
  - *Movement:* Palms start above the head, arms slightly bent
  - *Visualization:* Draw bright white light from "Father Sky" into your mid dan tien (solar plexus).
  - *Action:* As you inhale, slowly draw your hands down to the mid dan tien, palms facing each other, visualizing tendrils of white light coming down from the source and into your mid dan tien.

2. **Pause (Integration):**
  - *Movement:* Palms at Mid Dan Tien
  - *Visualization:* White light saturates your mid dan tien.
  - *Action:* Pausing in your breath, watch as the white light fills your mid dan tien, turning it into a 
    glowing yellow ball of energy

3. **Exhale (Grounding):**
  - *Movement:* Palms push toward earth
  - *Visualization:* White energy flows down through your body, forming willow-like roots in the earth.
  - *Action:* As you exhale, push your palms towards the Earth. The yellow energy from your mid dan tien
    flows down your body, through your feet, into the ground. Imagine the roots of a tree forming under your feet.

4. **Inhale (Energy from Below):**
  - *Movement:* Palms pull upward from earth to mid dan tien
  - *Visualization:* Draw vibrant green energy from "Mother Earth's" core into your mid dan tien.
  - *Action:* Bring your palms back to your mid dan tien. As you draw your breath in, visualize that green energy pulling from the center of the earth into your bubbling well (the arch of your foot), traveling up to your mid dan tien.

5. **Pause (Integration):**
  - *Movement:* Palms at Mid Dan Tien
  - *Visualization:* Green energy fills your mid dan tien.
  - *Action:* Pausing in your breath, watch as the green light fills your mid dan tien, turning it into a
    glowing green ball of energy

6. **Exhale (Expansion):**
  - *Movement:* Palms rise to Upper Dan Tien
  - *Visualization:* Green energy flows from your mid dan tien up your chest, throat, chin, skull, scalp, 
    as the energy leaves your scalp, it forms leaves like a willow tree, at first going up, then out, and 
    finally curling back to the ground, while your hands remain above your head.
  - *Action:* Exhale, raising your palms to above your head, while visualizing the green energy rising 
    through your body, and out the crown of your head, blossoming like willow leaves that cascade back to earth.

### 3. Foundational Postures

- **Standing in Wu Chi:**  
  Begin in Wu Chi (Wuji), the primordial state of stillness and undifferentiated potential—before the separation of yin and yang. In Chinese philosophy, Wu Chi represents the limitless void or the “no-thing” from which all duality arises. As you move and breathe, you actively transition from this unified stillness into the dynamic interplay of yin and yang, embodying the creative process at the heart of energy practice.

- **Gentle Shaking:**  
  Incorporate light shaking to stimulate lymphatic flow and release tension before beginning the sequence.

---

## Integrating "Total Breath" from *The Healing Power of the Breath*

Deepen your practice with "total breath"—a slow, rhythmic breathing technique clinically shown to reduce stress and enhance vitality:

- **Breath Rhythm:**  
  Aim for 5-6 breaths/minute (10-12 seconds/cycle). Align with the four-part structure:
- Inhale (4s) → Pause (4s) → Exhale (4s) → Pause (4s)

- **Diaphragmatic Engagement:**  
  Breathe deeply into your belly to stimulate the vagus nerve and activate the parasympathetic nervous system.
- **Synced Visualization:**  
  Pair each breath phase with corresponding energy movements for amplified effects.

**Benefits of Total Breath**  
Research shows this practice can:
- Reduce anxiety and depression
- Improve sleep quality
- Enhance emotional balance
- Boost overall vitality

> “Breathing practices activate communication pathways between the mind and the body, positively impacting the brain and calming the stress response.”  
> — *The Healing Power of the Breath*

## Bringing It All Together

This unified practice creates a powerful mind-body synergy:
1. **Physical:** Wu Chi posture and gentle shaking prepare your body
2. **Energetic:** Breath-guided movements cultivate qi flow
3. **Mental:** Vivid visualizations anchor awareness
4. **Physiological:** Total breath optimizes nervous system balance

### Practice Tips
- **Beginner:** Start with 3-second breath phases (5 breaths/minute)
- **Advanced:** Progress to 15-second phases (1 breath/minute)
- **Daily:** Practice 5-10 minutes for cumulative benefits
- **Key Focus:** Maintain diaphragmatic breathing and vivid imagery

## Everyday Application

You can use this energy practice as a daily ritual for grounding, clarity, and resilience. Its simplicity
and accessibility mean you can return to it whenever you need a reset—at home, at work, or anywhere you 
seek balance.

# Energy Practice: Blending Ritual Visualization, Qi Exercises, and Total Breath

Combining the subtle energy work from *Ritual: An Essential Grimoire*, foundational qi exercises from Rick Krause, and the clinically researched "total breath" from *The Healing Power of the Breath* by Drs. Richard P. Brown and Patricia L. Gerbarg, this practice offers a holistic approach to cultivating vitality, grounding, and spiritual clarity. Through intentional breathwork, visualization, and movement, you can harmonize body and mind, drawing on both ancient wisdom and modern science.

## The Practice Flow

### 1. Four-Part Breathing

Begin with a rhythmic, four-part breath to center yourself:

- **Inhale**
- **Pause**
- **Exhale**
- **Pause**

This breathing structure calms the mind and prepares the body for deeper energetic work, echoing techniques recommended for both subtle energy and breathwork practices.

### 2. Directional Energy Movement

With each breath cycle, guide your awareness and hands through a sequence aligned with the body's energy centers (Dan Tiens):

- **Palms at Upper Dan Tien:** Pull energy from above, visualizing white light entering.
- **Palms at Mid Dan Tien:** Let this white energy fill your center.
- **Palms to the Ground:** Push the energy down through your body, visualizing roots forming deep into the earth.
- **Palms Pulling from Below:** Draw green energy up from the earth’s core.
- **Palms at Mid Dan Tien:** Let this green energy fill your center.
- **Palms to Upper Dan Tien:** Visualize the green energy rising, sprouting leaves like a willow tree.

### 3. General Visualization

- **Inhale:** Picture white tendrils of energy descending from above, filling your midsection with qi.
- **Exhale:** Imagine this energy flowing downward, rooting you to the earth.
- **Inhale:** Draw green energy up from the earth, filling your center.
- **Exhale:** Visualize green energy rising through your body, sprouting like willow leaves from your crown and cascading back to the ground.

These visualizations are inspired by grounding and energy-cleansing rituals, emphasizing the importance of connecting with both celestial and terrestrial sources of energy.

### 4. Standing in Wu Chi

Adopt the Wu Chi stance—a relaxed, upright posture used in qigong and tai chi to cultivate stillness and readiness. Gentle shaking can be added to stimulate the lymphatic system and release tension, a practice known for its benefits in both qigong and modern movement therapies.

### 5. Gathering Qi from Above

- Raise your hands, palms facing the sky, and look upward.
- Visualize an infinitely bright white light above, representing a safe, limitless source of energy.
- As you inhale, slowly draw your hands down in front of your body, palms facing each other, visualizing white light entering your midsection.
- Pause, letting the light saturate your center.
- Exhale, pushing your palms down, visualizing energy flowing through your body and into the earth, forming strong, stable roots.

### 6. Drawing Qi from Below

- Bring your palms back to your midsection.
- Visualize pulling vibrant green energy from the earth’s core, drawing it up through your feet and legs to your center.
- Pause, allowing this green energy to fill your midsection.
- Exhale, raising your palms and visualizing the green energy rising through your body and out the crown of your head, blossoming like willow leaves.

## Integrating "Total Breath" from *The Healing Power of the Breath*

To deepen the benefits of this practice, incorporate "total breath"—a slow, rhythmic, and conscious breathing technique. Drs. Brown and Gerbarg recommend:

- **Slow, Coherent Breathing:** Aim for a breath cycle of about 10–12 seconds (five to six breaths per minute), or as slow as is comfortable for you. This aligns with the four-part breathing structure, where you inhale, pause, exhale, and pause again, each for an equal count.
- **Diaphragmatic Engagement:** Breathe deeply into your diaphragm, allowing your belly to rise on the inhale and fall on the exhale. This increases oxygenation and stimulates the vagus nerve, promoting relaxation and activating the parasympathetic nervous system.
- **Visualization and Intention:** As you practice total breath, pair each phase of the breath with the energy visualizations from the ritual and qi exercises, amplifying the effects of both.

**Benefits of Total Breath**

Research and clinical experience show that total breath can:

- Reduce anxiety and depression
- Improve sleep and resilience to stress
- Enhance concentration and emotional balance
- Support trauma recovery and overall vitality

## Bringing It All Together

By blending total breath with the visualization and movement elements of this energy practice, you create a powerful, holistic routine. Each slow, intentional breath becomes a vehicle for both physiological and energetic transformation, grounding you in the present while opening pathways for healing and growth.

### Tips for Practice

- **Set an Intention:** Begin with a simple affirmation or intention for your practice.
- **Move Slowly:** Allow your breath and movement to guide each other.
- **Visualize Vividly:** The more clearly you picture the energy, the deeper the effect.
- **Practice Regularly:** Consistency is key for lasting benefits.

* As you inhale
  * Bring your palms back up to your mid dan tien
  * Visualize pulling green energy from mother earth - imagine the a huge green ball at the 
    center of the earth. That green ball of energy is the source of creation on the earth. 
  * As you draw your breath in, that green energy pulls from the center of the earth into your 
    bubbling well (the arch of your foot at its highest point approximately, if you push

    15 second pause - unless you do a lot of exercise and breath practice, this is stretch goal
  * But for most people, 3 seconds per part will give 5 breaths, which is coherent breathing
    * We are adding visualization to this (aka breath moving), so we are nearly doing total 
      breathing
    * If you add constricted, or Ujjayi breathing, then you are also doing total breathing 
      (Brown, Gerbarg)
    * There's a great deal of clinical research
    * One difference, they generally do 6 seconds in/out. But the ratio is 5 breaths per second
    * If you are taller than 6' 2", you might need to breath a bit slower
  * Include breathing into your diaphragm
    * Stimulates vagus nerve
    * Parasympathetic upregulating
