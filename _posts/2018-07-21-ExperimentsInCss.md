# What is this
I put too many things in when I write. I like sidebars. Right now I'm keeping those in, eventually I 
might convince myself that I don't need them.

I'm hoping to follow some examples I found about pure CSS collapsible sections and make them work
in Jekyll. Once I've done that, I want to make them easy to use in my blog.

<aside>
<h1>The Section In Question</h1>
When this blog is out of draft, this section will be here but collapsed by default. 
</aside.

As the aside above says, when this blog is out of draft, the asside above will be expandable but collapsed
by default.
