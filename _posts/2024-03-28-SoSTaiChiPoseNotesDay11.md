Same as 2022.

# 2022 Class

## Bound Butterfly - seated

Props: 
* Strap
* Pillow or block

Setup:
* Put a loop in your strap big enough to go around your back and reach to your feet, the heals of which are 4 fists away from your groin
* Sit in butterfly
* One at a time, grab a foot and put it into the strap
* In a sitting position keeps your feet from sliding away

Pose:
* Butterfly, but with a strap around your waist

## Supine (bound) Butterfly
This is where the strap plays a bigger part. Also, in my experience, what worked sitting is too long for supine, but play with size of the loop.

Setup:
* Feet already bound
* Lean back

Tends to target inner thighs.

## Prone (bound) Butterfly
Now you are on your stomach. The strap keeps the feet from sliding, and the knees are nearly like side/box splits.

Setup:
* Back into a sitting position
* Roll to a side and get your knees pushing out to the side
* Elbows/chest to ground
