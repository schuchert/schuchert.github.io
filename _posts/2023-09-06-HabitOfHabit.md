When I teach Tai Chi, I try to leave the students with a thing they can do until the next class that is quick, easy
to do, and easy to repeat. For example, while sitting in a chair, focus on your fontanel (the soft spot on your head), 
push that point of your head up using your neck muscles.


While it is probably not obvious, this movement is one small part of rooting, and moving power through your body. 
It's also basic physics, and anatomy. So we can talk about the physical body, or the energy body here, there really
is a kinesthetic experience when you lock your body down and root. Doing that, and relaxing at the same time,
requires paying so much attention to your body, that you can experience a flow stat, and you can do this in a 
meditate state (as measured by a gadget).

I am and have been a software developer for some time. I've been practicing Tai Chi for about a decade, and in the past
few years I've been teaching it as a backup for my instructor. Much of my recent experience in software has been around
things like agility, lean, modern agile, but really, rapid feedback.

This is important because I try to cross domains all the time. So in software I really care about small batch size,
low work in process, and no queues (or handoff). This is an ideal, or a journey, rather than a destination. But it is
such an ideal against which I start to take things apart, to understand them.

When I teach Tai Chi, I try to apply those ideas. For example, while off the top of my head, I can think of 16
things (just tried) I could do while standing, before ever starting to move. Trying to do all of that is high work 
in process. As I teach, I'll mention 2 - 3 details while working through some exercises, but when we practice the
form, I suggest picking 1. Here are a few examples:
* Pull your Fontanel up while pulling your chin back a bit (this straightens the neck, puts the neck on top of the spine, and if you add pulling your shoulders down, it becomes a great stretch over time)
* Grip with your toes
* Keep your tailbone pushing down and tucked under (this pulls the perniem closer to the arch between feet, which both aligns the legs with the spine, and is a key part of so-called rooting)

Going back to the mid 80s, I started teaching computer literacy courses at a community college, while I attended
college.

All of this ha
This is going to take a bit to get through. Here’s a high level outline of where this is going.
Tai chi teaching
Day dream about small batch training ideas
Add new habit
Add a simple basic element as a habit
Once you’re doing it , do it again
Make a meta habit of forming habits
Working on habits that interrupt habits.
It’s a muscle. It can be strengthened. Rather than a muscled, its reinfocced neuron connections.
Attachment.
If any of this sounds good. And you are a software developer, are you doing Katas?
Moderation in all things
Paradox
Faith is that reality is built on paradox
Instability is required
Life is unstable - impermanence
To live by non paradox likely Leeds to attchsmen obsession
Attachment disorder
Jot something down
