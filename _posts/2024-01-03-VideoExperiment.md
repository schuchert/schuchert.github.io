## Background
During December, I released a series of videos to promote the upcoming World Tai Chi and Qigong day. I used some
psychology and lean thinking to get past imposter syndrome. I ran it as an experiment, with one goal
to be learning how to edit videos. This goal comes from wanting to help [Rick Krause](https://taichiokc.com/) 
promote his Tai Chi practice, as well as the larger Tai Chi and Qigong practitioners in the Oklahoma City area.

What follows are a few things I learned along the way.


## How did I get over imposter syndrome (at least so far)?
The initial interest was to help my mentor grow his practice. We have also recently started preparing for the 
next World Tai Chi and Qigong Day, on April 27, 2024. This two things 
I'm lucky to be a part of a group all dedicated to these things. We are starting to plan for the next 
World #TaiChi and #Qigong Day (If you've been following me, you know the date.)

So I kept thinking to myself, that's what I'm doing. I'm going to do this as a way to raise awareness for 
WTaQD. I point that out in the videos. If I didn't remind myself that most of the last two weeks of November, 
I would have stopped.

## How did I apply lean principles?
At the start, I had never edited videos, beyond trimming the ends. I needed a tools and techniques 
that would give me a way to both create videos, and learn how to do it along the way.

### Single Piece Flow

I recorded the first video. Ugly green shirt (so says my wife). While I considered what, how, etc., I 
made the decision that I wanted to add closed captioning.

I did a bit of research, several false starts, but I managed to find a tool that seemed adequate. So far it 
is, but, more importantly, I've made a few mental model and metaphorical / lateral learnings, so I have not 
found any needs to make improvements beyond this one in my pipeline. But I think if I were to change, 
I'd have little problem doing so.

### Work with constraints

I chose to use my phone and other existing equipment I had. One consequence is that lighting was limited to 
daylight, around the Winter Solstice. To address this transactional constraint, I batched up the raw video recording.

I did not do any batching of video recording until I had completed a single piece flow to all the platforms.

I know the light patterns and their impact on photography, along with the weather, that to record videos, 
I'd need to do them a bit ahead.



After the first video, I did a batch of 5 recordings. After that batching, I then did single piece flow to deployed, but not released. This mean that I produced the video, put it on YouTube, and scheduled its release.



So I batched recording due to time constraints, then used single piece flow to finish a batch of videos, before recording the next batch of videos.



** Devops? How does Devops apply?



I practice continue deployment with my well-neglected blog. If it's committed, it's published, but it'll probably have draft over it.



I practice immutable infrastructure with the videos. From the beginning to the end of this experiment, I've learned quite a few things, and have started to get a bit of a sense of how to express content-relevant ideas.



None of the first 19 videos have any of that. I considered going back and redoing them, but that fails on several points:

* it's a large backlog

* yes the newer ones are "better" but the are also more visually complex, so there could be an advantage

* I like the historical record of the growth of the style



## The lines
* Stop trying to kill your ego, de-anthropomorphize it through moving meditation.
* Make use of those 700 new neurons created by your Hippocampus every day.
* Whatever your chaos baseline, raise above it a touch with some intentional body jirations.
* In this time of winter blues, raise your qi with some sweet, slow moves.
* This meat-suite we each occupy lacks user manuals. Learn to better control yours.
* You can learn new things up until you die, but you need to participate in your life physically to do so.
* Warning, practicing moving meditation might loosen your connection with consensus reality.
* What are you doing reading this?! Get control of your parasympathetic nervous system.
* You shorten you hips when you sit. You might be doing it when you stand. Avoid the walker!
* Losing height? Want to slowly stretch your spine and get some of it back (maybe a bonus articulation)?
* Re-train your brain by focusing on your feet. Find an event near you and join a world wide community of feet focused folk.
* Be a ninja. Fix your posture while you sit at work. And nobody will know you're doing it.
* The Winter Solstice approaches. Be prepared to raise you Yang side with the Swimming Dragon Diving for the Pearl of Wisdom.
* Manipulate your Multiverse.
* We're getting close to the Winter Solstice. Bring up some yang energy to revitalized your mid dantian.
* Your intention informs your attention. Your attention informs your reality. One path into reality bending is through #TaiChi or #Qigong
* This #qigong exercise will help you remain supple for the next time you break into The Time Warp Again.
* Resist the monolith: Melted sand and corporate greed are hijacking your nervous system. Give your Vagus nerve a nice hug by practicing #TaiChi or #gigong.
* Find new ways to pop your joints learn to twist your body like you're DNA.
* Reclaim your attention from all the VUCA in your life through #TaiChi or #Qigong.
* Control your body, control your mind, earn meditation points if you're into spiritual materialism.
* As this holiday season thickens, giving your parasympathetic nervous system some attention can really keep you going. Do you believe you are worth some self car?
* Want to learn how to better control this meat suit you occupy?
* Would you like a way to down-regulate your sympathetic nervous system? In just a few minutes. The only equipment required is practice and presence.
