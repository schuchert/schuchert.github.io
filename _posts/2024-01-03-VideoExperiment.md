## Background
During December, I released a series of videos to promote the upcoming World Tai Chi and Qigong day. I used some
psychology and lean thinking to get past imposter syndrome. I ran it as an experiment, with one goal
to be learning how to edit videos. This goal comes from wanting to help [Rick Krause](https://taichiokc.com/) 
promote his Tai Chi practice, as well as the larger Tai Chi and Qigong practitioners in the Oklahoma City area.

What follows are a few things I learned along the way.

## How did I get over imposter syndrome (at least so far)?
A lucky confluence of events lead to even starting, and it also was the basis of not stopping.

I've recently been working with a local group to promote Tai Chi and Qigong. Rick wanted to record a video 
for this event. And this all happened around a week of vacation in November, so I decided to do some on my own, 
along with Rick.

Imposter syndrome set it. There's a million videos, I'm relatively new to the practice, etc. If I were doing
this for myself, that's game over. Several times I reminded myself that I was helping promote an event that
I'm certainly interested in.

So I kept thinking to myself, that's what I'm doing. I'm going to do this as a way to raise awareness for 
WTaQD. I point that out in the videos. If I didn't remind myself that most of the last two weeks of November, 
I would have stopped.

> Do it for someone / something else to help trick your imposter (lovingly).

## How did I apply lean thinking?
At the start, I had hardly edited videos beyond trimming the ends. I needed a tools and techniques 
that would give me a way to both create videos, and learn how to do it along the way. I had also had a recent
miss with trying to help a friend, so I want to do a bit more than I had in the past.

### Single Piece Flow

I recorded [the first video](https://youtu.be/fVaEt4vJkQo). Ugly green shirt (so says my wife). While I 
considered what, how, etc., I made the decision that I wanted to add closed captioning. 

I did a bit of research, had several false starts, but I managed to find a tool that seemed adequate. 

Before finally deciding, I completed 1 video. That done, I set out repeat the process.

It took hours for me to figure out how to edit the subtitles the second time. I was missing some mental model. 
Also, the mechanism is so "obvious" that you can't google it. I wasn't yet able to take in all the visual 
information. That hiccup lead me to seeing the timeline differently. That turned out to be a crack in a 
damn in terms of mental model changes.

In any case, the process is repeatable, but after the first deployment, I started batching based on light constraints.

#### Light Constraints & Devops

After the first video, I did a batch of 5 recordings. This was due natural lighting, near the Winter Solstice, 
when plenty of cloudy weather, and how it impacts photography. I lucked upon this. I recorded 5 more videos 
back to back, then the weather turned, making it was a bit dark to record for a few days. Since I started in November, 
I had enough buffer of deployed videos, but I realized that I should record more than 1 video when the opportunity
was available. 

After that batching of 5, I then did single piece flow to deployed (it was on this second video I spent hours 
to realize I need to double-click on a bar in the timeline).

However, rather than doing continuous deployment, I choose to do a phased rollout. One per day. So continuous
deployment, scheduled released, but I did release a few early to a few people, so thy really were in production.

Even with this constraint, I worked enough in advance that I did not start a new batch of video recordings until
I had finished processing the current bash. I wanted to avoid huge backlogs. 

> Context matters. Batching based on physical constraints was an acknowledgement of "what is."
> Use single piece flow where you can

#### Even more Devops

I practice immutable infrastructure with the videos. From the beginning to the end of this experiment, I've learned 
quite a few things, one of my goals for doing this, and have started to get a bit of a sense of how to express 
content-relevant ideas.

None of the first 19 videos have any of that learning. I considered going back and redoing them, but that fails on 
several points:
* it's a large backlog
* yes the newer ones have more special effects, but the essential content is there
* I like the historical record of the growth of the style

## The lines
Collection of the tweets minus the common content:

* As this holiday season thickens, giving your parasympathetic nervous system some attention can really keep you going. Do you believe you are worth some self car?
* Be a ninja. Fix your posture while you sit at work. And nobody will know you're doing it.
* Control your body, control your mind, earn meditation points if you're into spiritual materialism.
* Find new ways to pop your joints learn to twist your body like you're DNA.
* In this time of winter blues, raise your qi with some sweet, slow moves.
* Losing height? Want to slowly stretch your spine and get some of it back (maybe a bonus articulation)?
* Make use of those 700 new neurons created by your Hippocampus every day.
* Manipulate your Multiverse.
* Re-train your brain by focusing on your feet. Find an event near you and join a world wide community of feet focused folk.
* Reclaim your attention from all the VUCA in your life through #TaiChi or #Qigong.
* Resist the monolith: Melted sand and corporate greed are hijacking your nervous system. Give your Vagus nerve a nice hug by practicing #TaiChi or #gigong.
* Stop trying to kill your ego, de-anthropomorphize it through moving meditation.
* The Winter Solstice approaches. Be prepared to raise you Yang side with the Swimming Dragon Diving for the Pearl of Wisdom.
* This #qigong exercise will help you remain supple for the next time you break into The Time Warp Again.
* This meat-suite we each occupy lacks user manuals. Learn to better control yours.
* Want to learn how to better control this meat suit you occupy?
* Warning, practicing moving meditation might loosen your connection with consensus reality.
* We're getting close to the Winter Solstice. Bring up some yang energy to revitalized your mid dantian.
* What are you doing reading this?! Get control of your parasympathetic nervous system.
* Whatever your chaos baseline, raise above it a touch with some intentional body jirations.
* Would you like a way to down-regulate your sympathetic nervous system? In just a few minutes. The only equipment required is practice and presence.
* You can learn new things up until you die, but you need to participate in your life physically to do so.
* You shorten you hips when you sit. You might be doing it when you stand. Avoid the walker!
* Your intention informs your attention. Your attention informs your reality. One path into reality bending is through #TaiChi or #Qigong
