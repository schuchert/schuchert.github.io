Off the top of my head, I can remember maybe 5 epiphanies I've had. While this is not one of those,
the feeling was nearly the same.

I've been learning a few different internal martial arts with [Rick Krause](http://taichiokc.com/) for maybe 8 years.
I started with Tai Chi (long form, Yang style). It took me several years to memorize. I'm still learning the form.
It's better to treat "learning the form" as a journey, rather than a destination.

I started learning another form with Rick around 2 - 3 years ago. It is called 
[Liuhebafa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liuhebafa), and when I started its practice, I was drawn to its
aesthetic compared Tai Chi. Where Tai Chi feels more martial in how I've been taught to expresse it, Liuhebafa feels 
more expansive; How I've been taught to express it both seems, and feels more circular, and more expressive.

In my probably failing memory, it took me 1.5 years to memorize the first 3/4ths of the form. From about
50% to 75% felt like it was taking exponentially longer. I remember weeks when I was not able to
keep adding to what I knew. I was mentally blocked (not just in learning the form, but generally).

I started meditating after finishing a book I highly recommend, "[How to Change Your Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Consciousness-Transcendence/dp/1594204225)."
It took me months to read and digest the book. However, to summarize my journey:
* Hum, psychedelics are interesting
* Oh, they might actually help with chronic pain and depression (hint, they can)
* I must get psychedelics
* Oh, well maybe they are not so powerful without having a trained shaman/psychotherapist (I am not equating those options)
* Oh, based on how Meditation works, it can be a path to the same thing (both psilocibin and meditation modulate the default mode network - just read the damn book)
* I'll start meditating because I can do that now, and if the universe sends me psychedelics, I'll consider that as well

I started meditating around mid november 2019, at the beginning of December 2019, I was flying to my consulting gig.
Just after settling in I started meditating, as I had been doing now for a few weeks. After about an hour, early in 
the flight since I started meditating before we took off, I decided to do something atypical.

I opened up my laptop and started watching videos of Rick practicing Liuhebafa. I helped him make the videos. 
I even have them split into 8 parts to make it easier to work on a section. Nothing for months
had stopped me from using those videos. However, I just didn't even consider it, up until then.

Over the next 75 minutes, I memorized the remaining 25% of the form by watching the videos, mimicking 
through visualization, under-expressed hand and foot motions, with my eyes closed. I started in the middle of video 6.
After finishing part 6, I started on part 7. 20 minutes later, I started the last part. I kept on part 8 until I got it,
then I worked through the new material. Immediately after my first successful completion of the
25% I had just memorized, I felt a rush of giddiness, I'd say I was seeing starts, but that's not right, but some kind 
of brief visual overload; At the time I thought I was momentarily in an altered state (most likely a rush of 
adrenaline). Then I was emotionally overwhelmed for several minutes (in a good way - and this experience is
what reminded me of how epiphanies have manifested in my body as they occur).

That all passed. I took a moment to burn the memory into my brain. Next, I then spent the remainder of the flight 
visualizing the entire form (sped up to work through it multiple times). I confirmed that I had the entire form 
memorized. I still did not, nor do I yet know the form some 14 months later as I write this (learning is a journey,
not a destination), but I was past a critical step.

To finish the evening, I left the plane, got my rental car, went to the hotel, all as usual. 
About 11:15 PM, I went down to the open area in front of the grand ballroom. I turned on some music,
and practiced the form. I made several minor missteps (still do, probably always will), but I made it
through the form.

I had been blocked for months. I started meditating. Overall, I thought things felt a bit quieter. 
Not "fixed" but overall reduced. Then 2 weeks in to daily meditation, bam! I memorize 25% of the form in under 
2 hours, where the first 75% had taken me 18 months, give or take.

I do not know that it was meditation that broke my internal mental block. It's just correlation. However, the more I 
meditate, and experiment with different environments, situations, styles, the more I don't care if it's only
correlation. 

I felt a recent mental shift near the end of November 2020. It feels like I went from mostly habituated meditation 
(I should meditate today) to wanting to meditate many days. Not every day, probably not even most days, but many days.
I guess less like an obligation to myself because I said I'd do it, and more like time for self-care, which I
been learning to accept is necessary.

Since that flight in December 2019, I have continued to refine my understanding of the form. I'm now working on 
Bagua circle walking, with a number of different palm changes (dragon, bear, single hook).

That's not to say that I still don't have my bad days. I do. I've regressed a bit on Bagua for a few weeks. However,
even after most bad days, I remember, so long as I didn't kill anybody today, tomorrow can be a better day.

I'll leave with this analogy:
* resistance training is to your muscles, what meditation is to your mind

If you want a strong brain, consider giving meditation a try.
