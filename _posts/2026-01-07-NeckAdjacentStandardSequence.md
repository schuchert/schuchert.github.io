**Comprehensive Guide**  
*Targets neck tension via shoulders, upper back, and spine using Science of Stretching principles. Standard: 11
minutes (minimal stretches). Full: 30 minutes w/warm-up & close. Consistent 4-5x/week yields control over neck
issues.*

## Why Neck-Adjacent?

Direct neck work risks injury; this sequence stretches adjacent tissues (traps, shoulder blades, hamstrings) for
referral relief. Builds strength, mobility, parasympathetic calm via vagus stimulation. Ideal evening routine—do last,
before bed.

## Key Principles

- **Breathe to Relax**: 5 breaths/min (inhale 4, exhale 8 for calm).
- **Wet Noodle**: Passive tension, relax into holds 2-5 minutes for remodeling.
- **Passive Tension Over Time**: 2-5 minutes unlocks neurological unwind and tissue change.
- **Feel > Form**: Props enable deeper relaxation. Exit slowly to avoid cascades.
- **Work From Where You Are**: Injured/tight days: Scale back, still move. Progress varies—detach from highs.
- **Consistency**: Micro-sessions add up; neurological retraining via repetition.

## Full Sequence

### Warm-Up (3-5 min)

1. **Shake**: Feet parallel (~hip width), knees bent, sacrum tucked (heel pressure via ligaments). Bounce full body,
   eyes lead breath (inhale 6/exhale 6, mouth open).
2. **Neck Mobility**: Eyes lead head up/down/sides, then circles (slow on tender spots).
3. **Isometrics (30s each)**: Right/left hand to head side; both hands front/back; upward (tuck tailbone, fontanelle up,
   grip toes).
4. **Reset**: Partial forward fold (arms on thighs), relax spine. Alt: Supine knees up.

### Minimal Stretches (8 min + transitions = 11 min)

2-minute holds each: Cliffhanger, Pretzel Arms (right forward), Pretzel Arms (left forward), Wide Dog.

### Stretches Expanded (8-20 min)

| Pose                         | Setup                                                                                                        | Hold    | Targets & Tips                                         |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Cliffhanger                  | Prone, head to wall, arms overhead >shoulder width. Drop chest/shoulders. Toes curled. Clean hands for grip. | 2-5 min | Shoulders/traps. Post-3.5 min: Exit slow vs spasm.     |
| Pretzel Arms (Right Forward) | Prone, right arm forward of left (elbows cross), chin on right arm. Pillow optional.                         | 2-5 min | Diagonal shoulder blades. Breathe through awkwardness. |
| Pretzel Arms (Left Forward)  | Prone, left arm forward of right (elbows cross), chin on left arm. Pillow optional.                          | 2-5 min | Diagonal shoulder blades. Breathe through awkwardness. |
| Wide Dog                     | Wide feet, narrow/elevated hands, knees bent, sternum to floor btwn blades.                                  | 2-5 min | Upper back/hamstrings. Props for balance.              |

### Closing (2 min)

1. Shake.
2. Twists: Arms up, oppose shoulders/hips (Tai Chi foot push optional).
3. Pelvic Floor: Feet parallel/bent, sacrum down (perineum to mid-arch/"bubbling well"), fontanelle up, internal arms,
   sternum drops. Release slow.

## Progressions

- **Minimal**: 2-min holds x4 stretches (11 min).
- **Standard**: Add warm-up/close (~25 min).
- **Advanced**: 5 min holds, bench/pillow props, external thigh rotation in close.
