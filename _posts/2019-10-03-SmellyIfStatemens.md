## Caveat

This article is giving examples of how to replace if statements with polymorphism.
It is as much about mental models as anything. I mention this because as you
get toward the end, the solutions are more esoteric. It's unlikely they are 
generally good ideas you'll use often, but they fill in a mental model, so 
I think taking an idea (probably) too far, helps to understand the span
of an idea's applicability. 

## Background

In 1989, working in Smalltalk, I had one of my early epiphanies related to
OO programming. I was playing around with booleans:
~~~ Smalltalk
(a < b) ifTrue: [ do something ] ifFalse: [ do something else ]
~~~
In this case, the first part, ```(a < b)```, results in an instance of Boolean, 
either True or False.

When you send the (keyword) message with its two parameters:
~~~ Smalltalk
ifTrue: [ do something ] ifFalse: [ do something else ]
~~~

The message is: ```ifTrue:ifFalse:```. It takes two parameters, each a block
closure. 

When the recipient of the message is True, then True's method executes 
the ```[ do something]``` block closure.

When the recipient of the message is False, then False's method executes 
```[ do something else]``` block closure.

Notice that while the word if does appear, **this is not boolean logic**. This 
is polymorphism. 

{% include aside/start id="polymorphism" title="Polymorphism" %}
Polymorphism, same message, different method, based on the type of the receiver.
I do not include overloading in polymorphism in general, and it won't be an issue
in this article.

To get polymorphism in a class-based, statically typed OO language like C#, Java, C++,
there are 7 things necessary:
* Have a base class with at least one method that can be overridden by a derived class
* Have subclasses of the base class that actually overrides the base class method
* Create instances of the subclasses
* Send the same message to different instances

In this case, we have the following:

## Background

Imagine you have a mature code base that’s been in use for a decade. 
It is under active development, with multiple teams working in the 
code. While the code does not have a full suite of regression
checks, though there are a number of automated checks that provide some
idea of whether you've broken something.

{% include aside/start id="checking-versus-testing" title="Checking vs. Testing" %}
In [Testing and Checking Refined](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856),
James Bach and Michael Bolton provide a distinction between the
***Testing*** and ***Checking***. From that article:
> ***Testing*** is the process of evaluating a product by learning
about it through exploration and experimentation, which includes
to some degree: questioning, study, modeling, observation, inference, etc.

> ***Checking*** is the process of making evaluations by applying
algorithmic decision rules to specific observations of a product.

So when we practice [Test Driven Development(TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
we start thinking about a small part of the problem we think
we understand, codify it as an experiment (a failing test).
We work to make the production code pass. If, along the way,
we took too big of a step, we might fail that experiment
and try another. Eventually we have a complete TDD cycle.
The resulting "test" is what Bach and Bolton would call
a check.

We start with exploration. We conclude with learning.
We start with testing. We end up with a check that
serves as one thread in a safety net to keep the current
system working as it grows.
{% include aside/end %}

Current development practices in this code base make continuous 
integration impossible, while this will change in the future,
it is a reality now.

{% include aside/start id="continuous-integration-defined" title="Continuous Integration Defined" %}
I also subscribe to Martin Folwer's definition of [Continuous Integration(CI)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html).

In his definition, committers (he uses person, but a committer
might be one of: person, pair, mob) integrate their work at
least daily, and that work is backed by a safety net of automated
checks.

I believe CI is a practice that helps maintain delivering value
beyond the first release much more likely.

Refactoring is something that need to be done to support growing
software incrementally. CI allows team members to learn early
and often if their efforts are converging or diverging.
{% include aside/end %}

In this kind of situation, I've observed that developers will avoid 
refactoring because it’s likely that doing so will break the work of 
other people in other teams.

While we want to move to more frequent integration, and new code is 
better covered by automated checks, how can we safely change the 
structure of the code now, while we wait for the process changes to 
catch up?

{% include aside/start id="legacy-refactoring" title="Legacy Code and Refactoring" %}
Michael Feathers defines legacy refactoring as "code without tests." Lets’ refine that a touch:

|----|----|
|tests|automated checks (be they micro, integration, regression, ...) |
|code|code that is in production (so whatever it is doing is "correct" unless we have explicit knowledge to the contrary)|

So applying these two changes we have:
> Code in production that does not have automated checks.

A typical first action with code lacking automated checks is to create 
characterization tests (checks), then refactor.

I will do this, but often I’ll make "safe" refactorings without automated 
checks. Safe in this context includes:
* A small number of refactorings, most of which are automated
* Refactorings that are semantically equivalent based on a solid understanding of the language in question
* Limited use of backwards incompatible changes, e.g., changing return type of a method, where the thing in question is "highly used."

As an example of "safe" legacy refactorings, have a look at the
[videos in this album on the subject](https://vimeo.com/manage/albums/1792554).
Specifically, [this video](https://vimeo.com/31927512) contrasts
getting legacy code under automated checks first by not changing
the code at all, and then by making a few safe legacy refactorings.

## Refactoring Databases

The book {{ page.refactoringDb }} describes how to maintain
a db schema over the life of a project. It introduces
recipes for making schema changes in a way that allow for
* Zero downtime
* Evolutionary design
* Co-habitation

The recipes come in two varieties:
* Solutions where one client directly interacts with the database
* Solutions where multiple clients, on their own release cadence,
interact with the same underlying database

The big difference here is that changes either might impact
one group or many groups. When they might impact many groups,
you either need to coordinate the work of multiple groups,
or you need to find an alternative way of working.

The first option, coordinating the work is often called
"big bang integration." It is typically hard, error prone, and
takes longer than anticipated.

What is an alternative way of working? At a high level,
all changes start with the creation of something new
rather than replacing something.

{% include aside/start id="refactoring-defined" title="Refactoring Defined" %}
I subscribe to [Martin Folwer's definition of refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DefinitionOfRefactoring.html).
> Refactoring (noun): a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior. - Martin Fowler

Changing the code to support new requirements is an example of
something that we need to do that is itself not refactoring. The
same thing applies to fixing bugs. In both cases, we are changing
observable behavior.

It's likely that while trying to fix a bug or support new
requirements, the work might be made easier through some
refactoring. However equating fixing a big and refactoring
is a mistake as they are different activities.

Fixing bugs and adding features are about (hopefully)
increasing the value a user receives from using your system.
Whereas refactoring is about enabling doing that.

The bugfixes and features are for your users. Refactoring
is directory for the developers and ultimately about
maintain flow throughout the life of a project.

## What does this look like?

Imagine you have a central class/function/module
(the box containing circles below) used in several places:

![](/assets/images/CreateFirst/InitialClass.jpg)

Let’s work through a few scenarios to see what options we have based on
what we’re trying to do.


### Scenario 1: Move something with no external clients

Suppose you need to make a change to the code in the circle labeled F. 
Further, suppose that the containing class makes that difficult, e.g., 
the class uses a library that requires a license server. It cannot be 
instantiated on a developer machine as they lack a license (real thing 
from another project, not made up).

I might do what Michael Feathers calls “sprout class.” As there are no 
external users, and few places where the code is used internally, this 
is a quick change that is likely safe:

![](/assets/images/CreateFirst/SproutClassFromInternalOnlyMethod.jpg)

The code in the F circle becomes its own class and the one place where
it was used in the original source now refers to this external class.

This allows quick improvement to F, simplifies the original class, and 
reduces the likelihood of merge conflicts.

This technique might, out of context, seem like the overall design is 
worse in that there are more classes. Also, this technique might make 
a class that is really just a function hiding in a class.

However, my definition of good enough is context dependent. Even if 
making F its own class is "worse" design in an overall sense, if doing
so makes it possible/easier to get automated checks on code I need to 
change, the "worse" is in fact "better."

### Scenario 2: Moving something with external uses

Next, imagine you want to move the C circle instead. While in the original
example there are four users of the code, two external, two internal. We can
externalize the code and maintain backwards compatibility. Doing this allows us
to increase the number of steps where the work is "stable." By stable, I mean
still compiles, and existing automated checks still pass.  

The primary difference is what happens to the original method. In the first
scenario, the method is fully moved into its own class and all code calling
it, now calls a method on the new class. In this next approach, the original
method still exists, but its implementation calls a method on the new class.

![](/assets/images/CreateFirst/SproutClassFromMethodWithExternalClients.jpg)

Notice that in this first version, we've created a new class that has the code
from C and other code that only C used.

Rather than remove the original method, we instead have it call into the new
class. This allows the code to be sprouted without having to change all
callers. It makes the change smaller, less likely to involve merge conflicts,
and I can safely do this kind of change in the absence of automated checks.

{% include aside/start id="pull-based-refactoring" title="Pull Based Refactoring" %}
I’m not going to do this without a reason. If this code does not need to be
changed to support new functionality, or fix a defect, then I’m not going to
change it. This is using pull, an actual need, rather than push, a possible
future need I’m taking care of just in case.

So in this situation, I’m sprouting this code because:
* I have a needed change
* The original class it was in is hard to instantiate
* My changes will be in C (or E or F)
* So I can now more easily get C under automated checks

So while I might start with what I’d call a “legacy refactoring,” it will
continue with getting automated checks around C and/or the changes I make to C.
{% include aside/end %}

In this case, the next commit might be to update both clients and D to call out
to C.

![](/assets/images/CreateFirst/FullySproutClassFromMethodWithExternalClients.jpg)

However, those 4 changes could each be their own commit.

If we do all of those changes in one commit, the commit is more likely to
conflict with other changes simply because it is larger. So a larger number of
smaller commits can make merging go more smoothly.

More importantly, if you are working on a class that happens to be an
internally distributed library or used in other projects either as a binary
dependency or even a source level dependency, or is invoked reflectively, it
might be the case that you don’t know all of the code that touches the original
method. 

Without a clear understanding of the code base, I can probably make the first
change, sprouting the class, safely. I might never make the next step, moving
all references to the internal version to the externalized version. 

However, irrespective of changing all the references, the first version with
the original method calling out gives enough wiggle room to get what I’m
touching now under automated checks. If I never make the global update of all
calls, it’s OK. 

## The First Step
The simple idea underlying this approach is that the first step is creational,
not destructive. Rather than killing the original method, which forces all
clients to change, keep it in place, but it now delegates its implementation.

This is protected variation. The original method remains in place, protecting
existing consumers from having to change. The underlying implementation
delegates to the new implementation, providing a single path of execution. If
there’s a need to eventually update all the client code, you can do it
incrementally. 

Since the required change can be done quickly, safely, and often with automated
refactorings, it can get merged into master sooner rather than later. This
allows us to make “big” changes in terms of getting work under automated
checks, and even significant redesign. However, we can do it in a way that
allows for quick turn around back to “green” that we can merge to master
frequently.
