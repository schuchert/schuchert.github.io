## An Experiment to Try

While this can be done sitting or standing, until you've practiced it, do this seated.
* Sit down (important) comfortably. 
* Put a hand lightly on your bellybutton. 
* Push your hand out with your diaphragm/stomach. 
* Hold that position lightly, no straining. 
* Breath slowly, out breath longer than in breath
* Observe your breath. Into what part of your body are your breathing?

While doing this, you might try to breath into your upper chest. I find it hard to do so when I am actively
engaging pushing out my belly.

## Why Does This Work?

The simple act of breathing slowly while keeping your stomach pushed out, is a deconstructed version of
diaphragmatic breathing. Diaphragmatic breathing reduces stress, inflammation, and is generally relaxing and calming.

You can prime the pump by pushing your stomach out, and holding it out. While not as effective as coordinating
your breath with your diaphragm, it is a quick way to signal to the body you'd like to start to calm down.

This works because of the mind-body connection; it's a 2-way street. Much like if you smile, 
it will help to lift your mood. If you push your stomach out, it will tend to move your breathing 
to a pattern than stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system.

It's also a good point of focus for practicing sitting meditation.

## The Laughing Buddha

The Laughing Buddha has a large, round belly. Like babies, he keeps it relaxed, playful, engaged in the moment. 
Keeping your stomach relaxed is itself a good practice, that can often feel hard to do. However, as a practice, 
it's something you can do anywhere, anytime.

Also, if you start practicing this now, after not too long, your brain will form a stronger association with the 
***action***, pushing your stomach out, and the ***reaction***, up-ticking the parasympathetic nervous system.

With sufficient practice, you'll find it becomes a quick way to stop digging the hole you
are currently digging. You might find yourself getting worked up, and breathing high into your
chest. Push your stomach out. Stop digging the hole.

You can actively assist in restoring yourself to the Laughing Buddha state by first
pushing your belly out.

Enjoy!
