## Kudos to [Rick Krause](https://taichiokc.com/)

## The Quick Version

Try the following experiment:
> Sit down (important) comfortably. Put a hand lightly on your bellybutton. Push it out with your diaphragm/stomach. 
> Hold that position lightly, no straining. Observe your breath. Into what part of your body are your breathing?

While doing this, you might try to breath into your upper chest. I find it hard to do so when I am actively
engaging pushing out my belly.

## The Practice

Here's a trick to give yourself a quick calming break:
* Sit comfortably (sitting is important, depending on how slowly you breathe, you can lower your CO2 levels, and your blood pressure, which will make you dizzy.)
* Push, and keep your stomach out
* Breath slowly, out breath longer than in breath

The simple act of slow breathing, pushing your stomach out, is a deconstructed version of diaphragmatic breathing.
Diaphragmatic breathing reduces stress, inflammation, and is generally relaxing and calming.

You can prime the pump by pushing your stomach out, and holding it out. While not as effective as coordinating 
your breath with your diaphragm, it is a quick way to signal to the body you'd like to start to calm down.

## Why Does This Work?

It's a 2-way street. Much like if you smile, it will help to life your mood. If you push your stomach out, it will
tend to move your breathing to a pattern than stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system.

It's also a good point of focus for practicing sitting meditation.
