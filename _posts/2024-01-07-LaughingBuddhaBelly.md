## An Experiment to Try

While this can be done sitting or standing, until you've practiced it, do this seated.
* Sit down (important) comfortably. 
* Put a hand lightly on your bellybutton. 
* Push your hand out with your diaphragm/stomach. 
* Hold that position lightly, no straining. 
* Observe your breath. Into what part of your body are your breathing?

While doing this, you might try to breath into your upper chest. I find it hard to do so when I am actively
engaging pushing out my belly.

## The Practice

Here's a trick to give yourself a quick calming break:
* Sit comfortably (sitting is important, depending on how slowly you breathe, you can lower your CO2 levels, and your blood pressure, which will make you dizzy.)
* Push, and keep your stomach out
* Breath slowly, out breath longer than in breath

The simple act of breathing slowly while keeping your stomach pushed out, is a deconstructed version of 
diaphragmatic breathing. Diaphragmatic breathing reduces stress, inflammation, and is generally relaxing and calming.

You can prime the pump by pushing your stomach out, and holding it out. While not as effective as coordinating 
your breath with your diaphragm, it is a quick way to signal to the body you'd like to start to calm down.

## Why Does This Work?

It's a 2-way street. Much like if you smile, it will help to life your mood. If you push your stomach out, it will
tend to move your breathing to a pattern than stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system.

It's also a good point of focus for practicing sitting meditation.

## The Laughing Buddha


The Laughing Buddha has a large, round belly. Like babies, he keeps it relaxed. Keeping your stomach relaxed is
itself a good practice, that can often feel hard to do. However, as a practice, it's something you can do
anywhere, anytime.

Also, if you start practicing this now, after not too long, your brain will form a stronger association with the 
action, pushing your stomach out, and the reaction, up-ticking the parasympathetic nervous system.

With sufficient practice, you'll find it becomes easier.
