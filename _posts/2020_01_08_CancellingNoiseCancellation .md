As I walked my dog today, I noticed that while I was wearing over the
ear, noise-cancelling headphones, I also had a pair of "true wireless",
noise-cancelling ear buds in my pocket. What would happen if I wore them both?

The quick version is, adding both does have some value, but a cheep pair 
of ear protectors, like I wear when mowing the law, do as much as an actual
additional noise-cancelling headphones.

When I got home, I put on the earbuds. Next, on go the over-the-ear noise-cancelling headphones.

At first, I had both turned on, with noise-cancelling enabled. Other than having two
headphones on, the earbuds sounded like they do normally. The external headphones,
with noise-cancelling on, didn't make much of a difference.

I ended up trying all combinations of on, off, transient noise enabled. Since order
is important, that meant a total of 9 combinations.

In short, having an external pair of over-the-ear headphones negates external noise well 
enough that you can wear the earbuds with noise-cancelling disabled to get the best overall
audio quality. The over-the-ear headphones didn't make much of a difference on, off, or
with transient noise enabled. 

Now that is settled, I'll not feel the need to wear both pairs in hope of some kind of
magical audio results. I really didn't expect much, though I did wonder if the simultaneous
noise-cancelling would somehow interfere with each other. Disappointingly, they did not.

Back when I started wearing noise-cancelling headphones (when a certain airline still flew
turbo props into CID), I went through 3 different manufactures before settling on my 
first pair. The first 3 pairs interacted with the turbo props and actually increased
the noise (resonance frequency stuff I guess). So had my two new pairs interacted, I would
have been pleasantly surprised.
