** These are taken from the last class offering, so far things have been the same**

General Notes:
* EPA - Effective, Progressive, Accessible

Are your poses effective. Follow the principals, use the pose chart, and adjust as makes sense. But check the feels. 
Know the indented areas of the stretch, and make sure the feels are there. The disregard what it looks like

Are they progressive. Always use a timer. Meet or beat your time. Did it 2 minutes yesterday? Then 2:05 today. Work 
first up to 2 minutes. Then for most poses max out at 5. If a pose is compound, longer might be appropriate. Side
splits is something not in the pose chart, but he has said you might hold this one up to 10 minutes.

Are they Accessible? Make modifications. Use a stool. Good things to consider for any pose (to release pressure on back):
* Raise your bum
* Bend your knees (seated, or standing)

## Blockhead
Modified forward fold where you rest your head/chin on any number of blocks

Principle: stuck in low back
* prop up bum
* prop up knee
* stool for support
* ** It's not about what it looks, it feel. Let the Iyengar people judge us, we are not doing yoga, we are doing deep flexibility, using yoga, different intention **
* Don't grab, walk hands forward and flip up.
  * The temptation to grab is big, even sell devices for that, but it violates wet noodle, 
* 
Props:
* blocks
* stool
* pillows

Set up a forward fold:
* Sit on your bum (might need to elevate with block/pillows)
* Extend your right leg in front of you
* Attach your left foot on to your right thigh, close to the groin is ok, ok to move towards knee ** guess: Do not put foot on knee, above, below, but not on **
* Place blocks around your knee, use as many as you need to rest your head/chin on them

Options:
* Bum elevated with block/pillow
* Knee small bend/elevated with block/pillow
* Bench in front of you, lean on it

## Wild Thing
Often used after side angle pose (block bridge is a modified version of side angle)

Instruction (from a side angle/block head)
* Place your left foot flat on the ground
* Reach back with your right arm
* Dont think, just do, Kick back

I think of this as a side plank
