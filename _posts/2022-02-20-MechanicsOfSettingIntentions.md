## Overview

Your subconscious is good at processing things for you. However, for it to do so, you need to 
give it some space to do so. 

One current model of cognition is the [Default Mode Network(DMN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network).
Among other things, your sense of self might be a consequence of the interaction of the nodes in the DMN.

Meditation, heavy task focus, experiencing the current moment, have a tendency to calm the DMN.

Your unconscious processing is not done in the DMN. The DMN is loud, usually active, and dominates your electric
meat bag.

So when you meditate, are in flow, experiencing now instead of then or later, the other parts of your brain, 
which normally cannot "hear" each other (because of too much electricity in your meat bag), can hear each other.

If you've sent an intention before meditation, as you calm your brain, that intention is something the rest of your
brain can chew on. 

Also, the more you allow your DMN to calm, the more these alternative nural pathways can be reinforced. That means
while changes will take a while to happen, you might occasionally make a huge leap because something either got 
reinforced, or weakened by this non DMN processing.
