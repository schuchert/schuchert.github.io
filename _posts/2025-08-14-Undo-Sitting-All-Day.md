## Purpose

Use this 5‑day rotation to systematically counteract the negative effects of prolonged sitting. Each day focuses on 3–4
long‑hold stretches targeting specific muscle groups and mobility restrictions. The routine ensures balanced coverage of
hips, spine, hamstrings, shoulders, and chest.

# Hamstring Stretch (Bent vs. Straight Knee)

## Main Areas Stretched

- **Straight knee:**  
  Stretches mainly the lower hamstrings and tendons behind the knee. Also loads the sciatic nerve, especially if tight.

  Focuses stretch on the muscle belly and upper hamstrings, reducing tension on the sciatic nerve.

## Sensations and Benefits

- Straight knee stretch gives a deep pull behind the knee and lower hamstrings.
- Bent knee stretch is gentler, less nerve tension, more muscle belly focus.
- Both methods complement each other for balanced hamstring flexibility.
