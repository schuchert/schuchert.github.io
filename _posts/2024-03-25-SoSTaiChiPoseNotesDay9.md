** These are taken from the last class offering, so far things have been the same**

## New Stuff in Clinic 
* Use two mats, in a cross, different colors. Allows you to swap angles without having to move your mat
* The first pose is about extension of the writes, he reviews that

## Reverse Dog
Warning: Highly leverages, you can get to 10/10 very quickly
Personal Experience: Heed this warning, go gently, but it does get better quickly because it is highly focused

* Start on hands and knees.
* Take each hand and rotate them laterally (to the outside)
  * Left is turning anti/counterclockwise (when looking down at them)
  * Right hand is turning clockwise
* Keep rotating until your middle finger (the social finger) is pointing back towards your knees
* First time I taught this to someone, she said to me (with a smile) "What did I do to you to make you hate me so much."

** DO NOT BOUNCE here or in any pose, this is a huge part of training your brain/executive function - and it translates to life**
** Do not go to 7/10 **

Options
* Got your hands rotated, stop here
* Drop your bum back to your heals, but carefully, slowly
* Up on your back leg
* Move into dog
* Bend your head down

## Block Bridge
The exact position of the block varies by person, you might put block in any configuration.
Do not feel any sharp shooting pain. This is the SI Joint, ** CAREFUL **
Play with this, and figure out what works.

Working on area three.
Setup:
* Lie on your back, supine, feet on mat
* Lift your midsection
* Put a block on your sacrum
* Relax over the block

Options
* Block on short side (large flat face) down and release
* Flip the block up on short side, long side aligned left to right (perpendicular to spine) and flop back
* Flip block on short side, long side aligned with spine, flop back
* Flip the block on the long side, and flop back

Might feel this in hips, even chest

## Block Noodle
Group classes often do not have enough stools. So use blocks. Targeting t-spine (thoracic)

Setup:
* stack of blocks
* Pillow on top
* Under scapula, bra line
* Reach back, arms straight, straight arms gives a better stretch 
* Drop your head back if that is available to you (it is not to me, I add another block to support my head/neck)
* Pushing your tongue into the roof of your mouth might active the muscles in your neck

Options:
* Different number of blocks
* Different block orientations
