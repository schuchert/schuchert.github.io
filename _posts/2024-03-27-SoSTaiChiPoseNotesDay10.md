Imagine someone's knees do not fully flex. Here are three pose adjustments using a stool.

Also, these are specific examples, take a step back and see the principle. Higher up generally makes a pose more
accessible for some.

ALSO, these supported poses are great to sit and watch TV/social media. But pay attention. You can stay in a supported
pose that feels like "nothing." After 20 minutes, your body will be talking to you. So do pay attention to time, 
and switch.

Careful of asymmetry. My left side is tighter, so I do only left side longer.
