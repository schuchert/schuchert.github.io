As I drove home today I noticed a motorcycle cop had pulled someone over. I was reminded of a motorcycle class I took 
from the local police department around Summer of 2005. It was a great experience and one of the things that
stuck with me was a comment from one of the officers about speed and skill.

In a nutshell, he said something like the following:
> Most people think going fast is impressive, but going slow takes much more skill.

To be clear, he was talking about giving demonstrations. Going slow is more difficult because of physics. 

However, for spectators, speed is interesting, and slow-driving skills are only interesting to fellow riders.

<aside>
<h1>Why is riding slow harder?</h1>
<p>Under about 12 - 15 miles an hour, you turn the front
wheel much like in a car. To go left, push forward on the right and pull on the left. It really is the same as
a car. To turn left, you rotate the steering wheel counter clockwise. The handle bars on the motorcycle also
turn counter clockwise if you look from aboe. This is steering. 

Things change around 15 miles an hour. At this speed and above, your tires are like gyroscopes. They resist 
turning from forward. Rather than turning the wheel left to go left (_**pulling**_ on the left handlebar), 
you deflect the front tire by_ **pushing**_ forward on the left side. This is called counter-steering.

At slow speeds, you also will "clutch" the bike, with the clutch variably, but partially engaged, while 
"rolling the throttle" or while increasing the RPMs of the engine, which engages the suspension and lowers 
the motorcycle's center of gravity.

So riding slowly is a difficult activity. If you don't ride, or you're looking for fancy tricks like 
jumps, none of these details are relevant as a spectator.

However, you are probably not here to learn about counter-steering, clutching, the three parts of a car 
lane, the impact of wind, heat, etc. on riding.

My mind then jumped to the thought of practing slow to moves fast.

This lead me to think about Tai Chi. I've been practicing since around August of 2015. At the beginning I was lucky
to not bump into other people while I tried to do the form. Now I occasionally fill in for my Sifu.

There's a lot going on when I practice. I'm about 3 years in and at a pretty deep level I'd say I'm nearly 
a beginner. I have memorized a version of the Yang Style long form.

I am not able to apply or remember much of what I've learned at any given moment. At some time through the form I'll
likely remember much of it, assuming I'm not distracted. The slower I go the more I can recall what I've learned so I can make continuous adjustments.

My body is to the point where it takes care of several of the details for me. What comes next seems "obvious" 
and "natural." All I need to do to confirm that the next thing is neither "obvious" nor "natural" is do try 
doing the form on the opposite side. When I do that my only hope is to slow down to the point of stopping 
to figure out what is next. And I still mostly fail.

I practice Tai Chi as walking meditation. I get more from practice when I practice slower. The more I can increase
the time it takes while moving continuously, and therefore slower, the more I get.

To an onlooker, there's not much going on. It's not obvious. It's slow. It must be easy. But the internal 
internal experience is nothing like the outward appearance.

# (Standing) Wu Chi
Early in 2018, one of the people I was coaching asked about Tai Chi. He said "teach me something." 
I worked on showing him how to stand.

Boring, right? How much is there to know about standing?!

I'm still a beginner, but here are a few things to consider when standing:
* Feet shoulder width apart
* Feet parallel to each other
* Toes just to outside of each big toe aligned with middle of ankle
* Balls of feet connecting to the ground
* Heal of feet connecting to the ground
* Form an arch between the balls of your feet, like a Japanese bridge
* Form an arch between the large ball of each foot and the heal of the foot
* Engage all five toes of each foot with the ground
* Knees slightly bent
* Knees pointing forward
* Pelvis neutral to straighten the lower back or the gate of life
* Spine erect
* Relaxed/collapsed chest
* Shoulders relaxed
* Elbows bent as if holding a beach ball
* Hands pointing to the lower Dan Tien (which is about two fingers below the belly button and about a third of the way into the body
* Neck erect
* Raise your head as if a string is connected to the fontanelle
* Chin slightly pushing in to the back of the neck

This is a good start at how to stand I suspect. I also suspect if I asked my Sifu, he'd triple the list as this
is only considering body awareness.

Oh, and that's what comes before doing the long form, which is give or take 138 steps, and about 15 different 
techniques with variations.

Doing all of this is quite tiring. And, the only way I'm able to keep track of all of this is by going slow, taking
quite a bit of time, and realizing that I'm going to maybe 20% merely OK at any given second, but the 20% will shift
consistently.

My colleague and I did this for maybe 5 minutes. I did not give him the entire list above but a much shorter list
of things to consdier. We did this for about 5 minutes. Even 5 minutes of intentional practice like this can feel
tiring as the practice encourages presence to the current moment, which takes effort.

Back to my drive home. I was getting close to home by now, and the idea of going slow to go fast lead me to 
think about coaching technical practices. 

A way I find helpful to learn a new language is to actually type it. Each language seems to have its own cadence.
I often fall back on typing C when I'm working in another language and get distracted. I can tell by the sound 
of the spacing, how my hands are moving, etc. what language I think I'm typing.

Once I've learned the basics of a language, I can start thinking at a higher level. Maybe I go to the
basics like coupling and cohesion, or assignment of responsibility, the SOLID principles, deign patterns, language
idioms, test-first, and so on.

When I move to this level, I do the same thing I did at the languag level. I take time practicing techniques, 
problems, and even keyboard shortcuts to get this higher level of thinking connected to my kinesthetic memory.

One great way to do that is is through code katas, or maybe full on programming problems. I have a few in my 
back pocket I lean on. Having accidentally practiced repition on a single problem for years because I was
teaching in the 90s, I both have quite a bit of experience with particular problems. More importantly, I have
practice practicing and learning how to make small variances in a solution to see what happens.

As a consultant and a coach, I see many people reluctant of "new" ideas like refactoring as described by 
Martin Fowler, or legacy refactoring as described by Michael Feathers.

Often work is too swamped to "waste" time learning the basics. However, much like luck is "good" if you
work in a way to have enough space/flex and can respond to events, and "bad" if there's no room to breath.
Taking time to step back and practice things slowly, deliberately, and consiouslly enables moving much more
quickly in the code base. Trying to move quickly in a code base without this practice might work, but 
I think it'll overall be slower.

However, if I can pair with someone and have them give the techniques a go, more often than not I see people
learn that many of these techniques and ideas are actually not too scary, are much more light weight than
then seem at first, and can really be effective.

In this case, we need to go slow enough to have the time to learn some "basic" (pun intended) ideas, and allow 
our System 1 thinking to learn patterns so we don't dismiss ideas that in the past we'd skip over because
of how we've learned up to that point.
