## Noodle

* Use a bench
* Stack of pillows
* Target is bra line

Setup
* Bench, stack of pillows
* Back towards bench
* Position yourself such that your bra line is at the far edge of the pillows
* Feet flat on ground, knees bent
* Wiggle, wiggle, until your bra line at the edge
* Relax back
* Arms straight behind you (it helps target the pose, arms out not as effective)
* (Personal) My neck cannot go back w/o pain, C4 issue. So I keep my elbows pointing back, then use my thuumbs to give my neck a rest

Options:
* Bench/Pillows
* More pillows
* Coffee table, even more pillows
* Arm of a couch

## Pretzel Arms - R/L Asymmetrical

* Use your mat
* Maybe a few pillows for your chest

Setup
* Lay on your stomach, supine
* Pillows under chest (optional)
* Start with Sphinx
* (Right Side) Cross your arms, right away from body, left in
* Slide your hands out, out, out (right hand going left, left hand going right)
* Sink your chin into your arms

Options
* Pillows under chest
* No pillows

## Jackknife Blaster - R/L Asymmetrical

* Might use stool
* Might use blocks
* Might use cushions for knees
* You need a wall/door

Setup
* Mat/cushion at wall
* On your hands and knees
* (Right) Slide back towards a wall
* Stool in front of you for support
* **Important** Your knee is supported when it is snug to the wall, you'll want to move it out, that gives you less protection

Options
* Back knee kissing the wall, front leg shin down
* Raise Torso using arms
* Raise Torso using blocks
* Raise torso using a stool
* Front foot on the ground 
  * Unlike regular blaster, foot **directly** under knee for support, we want it in front of knee for regular blaster

Dont' worry about getting your back to the wall
