## Overview
I have modified a version of a great ginger snap recipe. They are tasty, and they actually can help calm your stomach.

## The Basic Recipe
My wife has stomach issues, and we were not satisfied with the ginger snaps we could easily get. She found a recipe
that I started using, and modified a few times. First, the original 
[ginger snap recipe from Love and Olive Oil](https://www.mastercook.com/app/Recipe/WebRecipeDetails?recipeId=19995244). All credit goes to this
recipe, it's great. 

### Quick List of Variations

Here are several things you might try as adjustments to this great recipe.
* Cook for 14 minutes at 290 degrees for a softer or gooey cookie (and in my case, rotate after 7 minutes because my oven is uneven)
* Amber the butter (I often nearly burn the butter by design), on my stove that.s 4.5 / 10 for about 20 - 30 minutes
* Add about 1/2-cup less flour and definitely under cook the cookies (first bullet, and probably the most important bullet)
* Use sugar in the raw instead of plain cane sugar for different texture
* More ginger (all kinds), I add maybe an extra 10 - 20% of each of the 3 kinds of ginger, they are aggressively ginger

## What I do

I mostly follow the recipe as is (at least in my mind that's what I'm doing, you might disagree, but make these damn cookies).
* start melting the butter
* peel and grate the fresh ginger
* finely chop the crystallized ginger
* mix the flour and such in an 8-cub glass measuring cup
* put the ground ginger and cinnamon in a metal salad bowl (I use for hand mixing)
* once the butter is nearly burnt, throw it in with the spices
* about now, pre-heat oven to 290
* follow the remaining steps (waiting 2 minutes to start adding the next ingredients)
* mix everything by hand using a silicon spatula

The recipe says to refrigerate for 2 hours before baking. That is fine, but don't do that. Instead, make a small batch.
Refrigerate the rest. The longest I've left the batter in an air-tight container in the refrigerator and still baked 
the dough was around 8 weeks. I don't recommend that, but the cookies were entirely fine and neither my wife nor I
got sick, so seems like the ginger was still effective.
