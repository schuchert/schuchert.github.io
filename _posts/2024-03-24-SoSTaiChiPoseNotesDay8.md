# March 2024 Class

## Adjustments
If you understand the goals of a pose, and you understand the principles, and you work with your students to
understand where they are, you can make adjustments on the fly. This makes your teaching Accessible. Remember EPA.
Essential - we have too few poses to have filler. Is the pose doing something?
Progressive - is it clear where it is going? are you meeting or exceeding your hold times (and using a timer?)
Accessible - we reject structural limitation, if your student don't choose to move, they choose to lose. Go from where your student is, and modify so they can participate.
