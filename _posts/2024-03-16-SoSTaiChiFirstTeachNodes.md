## General

* Complete sentences
* Forgot to do moon squats, so will not work for certification
* Start with most accessible version of pose, rather than jumping right in
* Did get the principles covered many times
* Did share personal experiences relevant in general, and in specific examples
* Hope I got across "this is not yoga, it's deep flexibility using yoga"
* Generally slow down, but this got better as we moved through the class
* Walked around well
* Did eventually moderate my tone a bit, and did slow down.
* Repeated the principles (and on the handout) - good
* Avoid talking about how long I do the poses, it's factual, I'm trying to be helpful (I hope), but it sets up what we are doing as less, and it's not. It's a stepping stone to improvement. 
* My body feels great, but it takes me effort to get out of the poses, so this "weakness" is helpful for students.

## [Getting Organized](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=0&si=I9lzQlrKclN_BlmN)
* Slow down talking
* Be more prepared for layout, this was 5 minutes after Tai Chi class, so that's a bit situational.
* Ripley is OK for Tai Chi Students, and she was there because this was after Tai Chi, but she won't be at classes in the future

## [Establish Breathing](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=135&si=d4RNBLBsQa_tJOWl)
* Like comment about doing stuff uncomfortable
* Might have gotten into breathing a bit more quickly
* Good comment on compressing diaphragm

## [Rag Doll](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=269&si=YUMj33BEb2jt0etm)
* Going into rag doll, better demo - I convinced myself I was rushed because I was hoping to record cert video.
* Going into modification after (using the wall), get there first - start with most accessible version
* Good on modification
* I put my hand on my spine (for myself), turn around and show
* Good messaging around getting out of poses

## [Cliffhanger](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=506&si=nayI0WME_7fgZE7h)
* Setting up for cliffhanger, should start at the wall?
* Story about issues in tissues - true story, think it's worth mentioning
* Again, show a version of the pose adjusted. Considered using chairs and knees, but it would have been a bit hard on peoples' hands based on the available chairs. 
* Ripley is getting involved too much - everybody knows her, and is comfortable, but it'll probably distract people out of poses
* Only 1 person did the pose
* I was sticking to two minutes so I did not stop with 20% had dropped out, I thought about it, and chose to disregard that recommendation for today
* Did show how I get out of the pose - using diaphram, I'm demoing visually, but better verbal queues

## [Pretzel Left](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=842&si=hTXYPdogbBHlri67)
* Again, relying on visibility, verbal queues
* Question about doing twice, mentioned asymmetrical poses
* Mentioned modification - start with more accessible version (bit of a room issue)
* Still taking fast

## [Pretzel Right](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=1004&si=wrZv-uJi6WCnYhAW)
* "Just try to melt, melt your body into your mat"
* Mentioned tension over time, and sarcomeres - personal experience on impact of stretching
* Yin/Yang - using this model is good for me, and this class
* Reminded of this being after other stuff
* Warned about using body after - did say using body-based resistance training

## [Phoenix Arms](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=1157&si=HeyCZIJA3XfdLTDY)
* We did this in the Tai Chi class.

## Noodle - Skipped
Originally worried about Cliffhanger, but the room doesn't work for this pose. It's not a yoga studio, and
suffice it to say, I'll need props. Plan to work on a version of this pose using blocks, but as I have not done
that myself enough, I'll start now for next time.

## [Hero](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=1186&si=GUp2ttoEcswhjvUj)
* Forgot to mention that this stretched front of thighs
* Mentioned my messed up c4 - so personal stories, and personal challenges good
* Good - mentioned not feeling anything in lower back
* I keep talking about doing poses longer, drop that. It's implicit comparison, and I want people to start where they are
* Good - how to get out of poses
* Good stabby pain/area pain - it was based on a question
* Showing what I like to do after - maybe emphasize - this is an option

## [Wide Dog](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=1389&si=oeitwgmDlUsHDfoo)
* Sloppy intro
* Way too wide for Wide dog
* Good on discussing modification
* Again, showing by touching, but verbalize it
* Good - checking on touching
* Story - doing it and targeting back of legs, then brought up engaging the pelvic floor - really did my legs, and calves especially, much looser from years of stair master
* Based on question / talking about this not being yoga - student talked about micro bends, which is great to engage, and why we do not want to do that
* Emphasize Heals On The Ground
* Yang of yoga vs. yin of what we are doing ++
* mentioned indoor rock climbing, but probably not a good analogy for most
* Good commentary on nervous system
* Did mention that I can feel this pose on the ground, but I need to use lateral rotation, which is sending mixed messages to nervous system.

## [Twister Left](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=1799&si=gSt2SUK545aB-CQ5)
## [Twister Right](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=2030&si=Yp0c6Qb_LOGqGPv4)
* Video Comment: Got label wrong, both show twister left - won't fix

* **START High and Go Low**
* Show highly accessible version first, then work your way down as options
* I think this one I did well in terms of starting with accessible version
* Good commentary on directing hand to outside of leg
* Don't mention pulling leg, said it better later, but don't encourage yang stuff
* Continue repeating principles, good
* Mentioned interoception - keep doing that - mindful meditation using interoception to distract yourself
* Mentioned finding pulse in body - good distraction, and fun to do
* Good to mention feel of side we just twisted, it really does feel thinner
* Kissed Ripley, do love having her here. 
* Story about ego-ing through pose, ignoring pinch. True story, good to mention.

## [Washer Knees](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=2174&si=ErOF2DEkTAeiLK0V)
* This is a reset pose. 
* Mentioned transition/reset poses - more detail maybe? Sooner?

## [Blaster Right](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=2249&si=bhG8sqishmkh5Aec)
* Again, more accessible version of poses first
* Good commentary on pressure pose
* Mentioned asymmetrical
* Decent instruction I think
* Mention plantar flexion on back foot
* Again, mentioning how long I do the pose, reduce that
* Talked about using blanket to help me relax
* Reminder on rotating foot
* Good - mentioned how rotating foot moves where feel goes
* Good - showing how I got out of pose

## [Blaster Left](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=2401&si=vo69RdK3dd-3rXO1)
* Good, but remind about foot rotation
* Someone got cramps, good discussion on it
* Good story about stair master and tight calves
* Good mentioned empty stepping - which we practiced in class before
* Good, mention paying down future pain
* Good, how this has worked for me
* Good, how to get out of pose

## [Butterfly](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=2621&si=xUVRPTX6b-tiGZ5-)
* Good on fist distance
* Good, looking forward for lower back
* Good on using block to help with back
* Good adjustments 
* Bad, block doesn't work well for this - and started to get cramp in calf
* Good (I think) showing how I've used prayer palms to help gravity pull, and avoided discussing physics 
* Good - showing pillows and how the fold forward
* Again, when demoing physically, use your words :-) 
* Good, mention not pulling
* Good, working/relaxing mixed message
* Covered principles again

## [Pins & Needles -student question](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=2895&si=XuLQR9xZayioExS2)
* Asked about observations, gave demo to someone with ankle problems
* Good - mentioned 
* Curl toes - dorsiflexion - missed opportunity
* Good - mention using wall to keep knees from sliding too much
* Student asked - "What have I done to you for you to show me this pose?" )
* Tied it back to tai chi
* Did mention how to work into slowly
