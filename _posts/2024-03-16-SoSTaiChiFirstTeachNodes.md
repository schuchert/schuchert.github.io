## General

* Complete sentences
* Forgot to do moon squats, so will not work for certification
* Start with most accessible version of pose, rather than jumping right in
* Did get the principles covered many times
* Did share personal experiences relevant in general, and in specific examples
* Hope I got across "this is not yoga, it's deep flexibility using yoga"
* Generally slow down, but this got better as we moved through the class
* Walked around well
* Did eventually moderate my tone a bit, and did slow down.
* Repeated the principles (and on the handout) - good
* Avoid talking about how long I do the poses, it's factual, I'm trying to be helpful (I hope), but it sets up what we are doing as less, and it's not. It's a stepping stone to improvement. 

## [Getting Organized](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=0&si=I9lzQlrKclN_BlmN)
* Slow down talking
* Be more prepared for layout, this was 5 minutes after Tai Chi class, so that's a bit situational.
* Ripley is OK for Tai Chi Students, and she was there because this was after Tai Chi, but she won't be at classes in the future

## [Establish Breathing](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=135&si=d4RNBLBsQa_tJOWl)
* Like comment about doing stuff uncomfortable
* Might have gotten into breathing a bit more quickly
* Good comment on compressing diaphragm

## [Rag Doll](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=269&si=YUMj33BEb2jt0etm)
* Going into rag doll, better demo - I convinced myself I was rushed because I was hoping to record cert video.
* Going into modification after (using the wall), get there first - start with most accessible version
* Good on modification
* I put my hand on my spine (for myself), turn around and show
* Good messaging around getting out of poses

## [Cliffhanger](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=506&si=nayI0WME_7fgZE7h)
* Setting up for cliffhanger, should start at the wall?
* Story about issues in tissues - true story, think it's worth mentioning
* Again, show a version of the pose adjusted. Considered using chairs and knees, but it would have been a bit hard on peoples' hands based on the available chairs. 
* Ripley is getting involved too much - everybody knows her, and is comfortable, but it'll probably distract people out of poses
* Only 1 person did the pose
* I was sticking to two minutes so I did not stop with 20% had dropped out, I thought about it, and chose to disregard that recommendation for today
* Did show how I get out of the pose - using diaphram, I'm demoing visually, but better verbal queues

## [Pretzel Left](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=842&si=hTXYPdogbBHlri67)
* Again, relying on visibility, verbal queues
* Question about doing twice, mentioned asymmetrical poses
* Mentioned modification - start with more accessible version (bit of a room issue)
* Still taking fast

## [Pretzel Right](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=1004&si=wrZv-uJi6WCnYhAW)
* "Just try to melt, melt your body into your mat"
* Mentioned tension over time, and sarcomeres - personal experience on impact of stretching
* Yin/Yang - using this model is good for me, and this class
* Reminded of this being after other stuff
* Warned about using body after - did say using body-based resistance training

## [Phoenix Arms](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=1157&si=HeyCZIJA3XfdLTDY)
* We did this in the Tai Chi class.

## Noodle - Skipped
Originally worried about Cliffhanger, but the room doesn't work for this pose. It's not a yoga studio, and
suffice it to say, I'll need props. Plan to work on a version of this pose using blocks, but as I have not done
that myself enough, I'll start now for next time.

## [Hero](https://youtu.be/ezhKxmoe3Bw?t=1186&si=GUp2ttoEcswhjvUj)
* Forgot to mention that this stretched front of thighs
* Mentioned my messed up c4 - so personal stories, and personal challenges good
* Good - mentioned not feeling anything in lower back
* I keep talking about doing poses longer, drop that. It's implicit comparison, and I want people to start where they are
* Good - how to get out of poses
* Good stabby pain/area pain - it was based on a question
* Showing what I like to do after - maybe emphasize - this is an option
