## Introduction

In June 2018, Oklahoma voters passed a ballot initiative to legalize medical marijuana. Coincidentally, I was in
California the day the law passed, and, to mark the occasion, I picked up some THC-infused chocolate-covered espresso
beans. This small moment would spark a significant transformation in my health journey.

## Cannabis and My First Great Night’s Sleep in Decades

Having struggled with insomnia for over 20 years, despite trying prescription medications, melatonin, Benadryl, and even
pure CBD, I was more curious than hopeful. At age 51, I had spent much of my life avoiding marijuana, but I decided to
try 5 mg of THC at 8 PM one Tuesday. I went to sleep at 10 PM, flat on my back, and woke up—on my back—nine hours later,
stunned. I hadn’t slept that well in decades.

Repeated journaling over the next 4 years confirmed the effect: when I stopped using THC, my sleep quality dropped 
significantly after a few days, becoming terrible within a week. Once I resumed, my restful sleep returned within days.

## Dosing, Moderation, and Finding Balance

I realized a little goes a long way: even 10 mg was effective, and more wasn’t better; sometimes just habitual. Wanting
to avoid dependence, I switched to self-made tinctures using a low-THC, high-CBD (4:1 ratio) strain. My regimen: 7–10 mg
of THC, 2–3 mg of CBD each night, often with a bit more CBD. The result? Excellent sleep, with only mild drowsiness two
hours post-dose and no discernible perceptual changes.

## Surprising Revelation: Cannabis and Insulin Sensitivity

As I tracked my health, I noticed something unexpected: long-term, moderate THC use apparently improved my insulin
resistance and fasting blood glucose. Initially, my blood sugar spiked (up about 20 points to ~120), but after about ten
days, it dropped back to 103. It’s not where I want it, but it’s manageable with healthy dietary habits, less processed
foods, more healthy fats (grass-fed butter, coconut oil, olive oil), protein, and limited simple carbs.

While I don’t plan to return to a ketogenic diet, I focus on unprocessed fats and avoid seed oils (even though rancid 
oils may not increase inflammation, they burden the body with unnecessary cleanup).

## Health, Habits, and Hope

This journey reminded me that, with patience and persistence, the body can adapt. Over ten days I reset my blood sugar,
and over years I reversed long-standing insulin resistance. Sleep, nutrition, moderate cannabis use, consistent
movement, and psychological self-care contributed to this transformation. I am living proof that even seemingly
intractable health problems can change with a holistic approach.
