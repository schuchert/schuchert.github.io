## Common
### Closing
* Return to a seated position
* Spend time on 4:4 breathing, through the nose
* This will help wake people up after all of that 4:8 breathing.
* Right hand over heart, left hand over belly button (for Tai Chi, center of palm where middle finger touches, the lao gong, centered about 2 fingers directly below belly button, to align with your lower Dantian, the pelvic floor where the reproductive organs are)
* Say, "May this practice heal my mind and my body" x 2

### Down Dog Twist - transition - x2
* Transition into a down dog
  * On your knees, tuck toes, push up into a down dog
* Reach your right hand over to the outside of your left ankle and hold on
* Look in the direction of your arm and then a bit up and back.
* Hold for a few seconds
* Release your hand and return to down dog
* Reach your left hand over to the outside of your right ankle
* Do this a few times, hold long on the last hold.

Options:
* If gripping your ankle is too much, move your hand up your leg.
  * (Guess) If you grab higher, **do not** use your knee, well above/below your knee, do not pull your knee!

### Establish Breathing
* Come to any seated position
* Begin by breathing in your nose, and out your mouth, making an "ah" sound
* Breath in to a count of 4, 1, 2, 3, 4
* Breath out to a count of 8, 7. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
* Repeat this once
* Say something like "continue breathing at your own pace."
* While your students breath, consider giving some background, such as (don't say all of this stuff, or any of this, feel the room)
  * Breathing out longer encourages your parasympathetic nervous system to turn on
  * This helps us relax, and it helps reduce your body's resistance to stretching
  * About 50% of what we are doing is training our brain
  * You are about to do some uncomfortable, by using your breath, you are telling your body "I know, this isn't familiar, but it is OK."
  * You are strengthening your executive function, weakening your monkey mind, and this may translate into the rest of your life.

### Moon Squats
We're going to continue (just established breathing) with an all body warm up.

* Stand in the middle of your mat 
* Place your feed hip-width or a bit wider apart
* Turn your feet out a bit, say 12 degrees
* Reach up, breath in, spread your fingers
* Now exhale, stick your bum back as you go down, down, down, down
* Reach up, take in a big breath, reach up, spread your fingers
* Look up, things are looking up
* Exhale, and sit down,
* Make fists and cross your wrists
* Sink your head into your wrist

Generally 3 sets of 5, but mix it up

### Plank Pose - transition
* Place your shins on your mat, hip width apart
* Place your hands on your mat, directly under your shoulders
* Curl your toes and press up into a plank
* Do this a few times
* On the last one, hold to a count of 5

Options:
