## Deep Flexibility Routine for Side Splits

### Summary

| Activity                       | Time / Reps             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Cassock Squat                  | 3 rounds, 5 each side   |
| Horse Stance                   | 3 × 60 sec              |
| Rag Doll                       | 5 Mins.                 |
| Seated Thread the Needle Right | 5 Mins.                 |
| Seated Thread the Needle Left  | 5 Mins.                 |
| Frog                           | 5 Mins.                 |
| Butterfly                      | 5 Mins.                 |
| Side Angle Right               | 5 Mins.                 |
| Side Angle Left                | 5 Mins.                 |
| Pancake                        | 10 Mins. w/PNF optional |

Times listes are the recommended maximum time. Generally, 2 minutes is enoguht time to
get into the pose, calm the nervious system, and get lasting structural change. After 5
minutes, you might find your time better spent a different pose. The final pose is longer
because it's a huge pose with different kinds of stretching going on, while involving
a large group of tighly intertwined muscles in the hips, and pelvic floor.

If you're unable to make the maximum time, try to work up to 2 minutes by adding 5 seconds
each time you practice the pose. Keep upping your time to get to 5 minutes. If the issue is
fatigue, use props, make adjustments, to enable to you to rest in the pose.

### Side Splits Warmup

#### Cassock Squats – 3 sets of 8-12 reps

_Muscles Strengthened and Stretched:_

- Adductors (inner thighs)
- Glutes
- Hamstrings
- Quadriceps
- Ankles and calves
- Core stability

_Why:_  
Builds frontal plane mobility, strength, and neuromuscular control. Improves hip, knee, and ankle mobility while strengthening adductors — essential for safe, controlled side split progress.

---

#### Horse Stance – 3 sets of 60 secs

_Muscles Strengthened:_

- Adductors
- Glutes
- Vastus medialis oblique (VMO)

_Why:_  
Builds active strength and endurance in hip adductors, key for holding leg positions in splits. Enhances pelvic stability with anterior pelvic tilt.

---

#### Rag Doll – 5 mins

_Muscles Stretched:_

- Hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus)
- Calves (gastrocnemius, soleus)
- Erector spinae (lower back)
- Latissimus dorsi
- Neck and shoulders (secondary)

_Why:_  
Decompresses spine and warms up posterior chain for deeper stretches.

---

#### Seated Thread the Needle (R/L) – 5 mins each

_Muscles Stretched:_

- Rhomboids
- Trapezius (middle/lower)
- Thoracic spine rotators
- Serratus posterior
- Shoulders and scapular stabilizers

_Why:_  
Opens thoracic spine for better forward fold mechanics and releases upper back tension that limits pancake depth.

---

### Main Stretching Sequence

#### Frog Stretch – 5 mins

_Muscles Stretched:_

- Adductor longus, brevis, magnus
- Pectineus

_Why:_  
Targets short adductors in abduction, an important bridge from bent knee to straight leg stretches. Bent knees isolate hip adductors without hamstring strain.

---

#### Butterfly – 5 mins

_Muscles Stretched:_

- Adductor longus, brevis, magnus
- Pectineus
- Gracilis
- Hip external rotators
- Pelvic floor
- Lower back

_Why:_  
Targets short adductors with bent knees—key prep for inner thigh flexibility in side splits.

---

#### Side Angle (R/L) – 5 mins each

_Muscles Stretched:_

- Hamstrings (medial and lateral)
- Adductors (inner thighs)
- Calves
- Quadratus lumborum (side body)
- Gluteus medius
- Intercostals
- Latissimus dorsi

_Why:_  
Combines lateral flexion with leg abduction; stretches medial hamstrings and side body for split alignment.

---

#### Pancake – 10 mins

_Muscles Stretched:_

- Medial hamstrings (semitendinosus, semimembranosus)
- Adductors (longus, brevis, magnus, gracilis)
- Biceps femoris
- Pectineus
- Erector spinae
- Latissimus dorsi
- Calves (with dorsiflexion)
- Hip external rotators
- Gluteus maximus

_Why:_  
Comprehensive stretch for side splits—integrates hamstrings and adductors with straight legs and forward hip tilt.

## Technique and Biomechanics

### Hip Positioning

- Keep a gentle **anterior pelvic tilt** (tailbone up) to avoid hip impingement.
- For some anatomies, **external rotation** (toes pointing upward) may be more comfortable.

---

## Training Frequency & Intensity

- Train **3–5 times per week** (not daily).
- Hold deep end-range positions **1–2 minutes** for maximal adductor adaptation.
- Combine **active** (horse stance, lifts) and **passive** stretches for neural retraining.
- Progress gradually—widen stance and deepen holds over weeks, not days.
