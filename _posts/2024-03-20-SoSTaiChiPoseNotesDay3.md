title: SoS for Tai Chi Post Notes
description: "Collecting notes from first two days, focusing on Accessible and working way lower, remember, feel, and noodle, I personally find doing several of the poses in another option improve the pose, when I don't this, it's my ego 'OH, look how stretchy I am' - doesn't help."

## General
* Good: start accessible and go to less
* Good: option/not level!!
* Good: feel not look
* Consider: Low WIP, don't give all notes every time
