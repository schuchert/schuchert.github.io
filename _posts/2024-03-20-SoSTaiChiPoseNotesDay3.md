title: SoS for Tai Chi Post Notes
description: "Collecting notes from day 3, focusing on Accessible and working way lower, remember, feel, and noodle, I personally find doing several of the poses in another option improve the pose, when I don't this, it's my ego 'OH, look how stretchy I am' - doesn't help."

## General
* Recommend/Good: Start right for assymetrical poses so second is always left
* Good: start accessible and go to less
* Good: option/not level!!
* Good: feel not look
* Consider: Low WIP, don't give all notes every time

## Double Pigeon (Right / Left)
* Option 1: Seated / seated lower
* Option 2: (kneed parallel to ground) / brick under top leg to support knee
* Option 3: Remove brick
  * Might be handy to have a folded pillow to assist leading forward

## Shoulder Pow (Right / Left)
* Any seated position
* Grab strap in top hand
* Swing arm around and allow strap to fall down your spine
* Always start with strap when demoing
* OK to grip fingers, but doesn't really add anything (ego).
* Flexing the top arm 
* Hyper-extension of lower arm

## Cliffhanger
This one starts with hard extension. It's because it's more intense that second option and people will want to stay there.

* Option 1: prone (on stomach)
  * Move to where crown of head is touching wall
  * Reach up with both arms
  * Fingers wide
  * Arms wider than shoulders
  * NOTE: elbow creases are UP UP UP - do not rotate either way, may stress elbow joint
* Option 2: Shins on ground, mat width apart
  * Use forearm as distance for knees (I found this too close, moved back a bit)
  * Reach up wall, fingers wide
  * Arms wider than shoulders

## Lightning Bolt
* Option 1: sitting on shins
  * Knees together
  * Put enough blocks/pillows under bum
  * Feet wide enough so that fingers fit between foot and bum
  * Feet outside of hips
* Option .5: For injuries
  * Sit on chair
  * Feet plantar flexed (pointing) and under your
  * Tops of toes touching ground

Real potential for negative talk - stop it

Work from where you are.
