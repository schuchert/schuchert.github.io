## General
Work from where you are. Something is better than nothing. Along with training your nervous system, you are training
your monkey brain to slow down. Be ok with progress, any progress, rather than perfection, which blocks you from
doing the pose because you "can't do it right."

* Recommend/Good: Start right for asymmetrical poses so second is always left
* Good: start accessible and go to less
* Good: option/not level!!
* Good: feel not look
* Consider: Low WIP (work in progress), don't give all notes every time, give one note, wait, allow it to be absorbed, then another, repeat, the deeper the pose, the softer your voice

## Double Pigeon (Right / Left)
Bricks/pillows under either / both knees is good
Difficulty moving forward?
* Block/pillow under bum
  * A thick foam seat cushion, folded in half, with the open part point back, and the "V" part under your bum gives a slight push forward.
* Put your arms behind you, 
  * fingers pointing back, 
  * arms straight
  * totally fine to put blocks under hands
  * Gradually move your hans closer to your bum
* If your hands are available (not pushing you forward), place on (palm up) on your ankle, other on knee

* Option 1: Seated / seated lower
* Option 2: (kneed parallel to ground) / brick under top leg to support knee
* Option 3: Remove brick
  * Might be handy to have a folded pillow to assist leading forward

## Shoulder Pow (Right / Left)
* Any seated position
* Grab strap in top hand
* Swing arm around and allow strap to fall down your spine
* Always start with strap when demoing
* OK to grip fingers, but doesn't really add anything (ego).
* Flexing the top arm 
* Hyper-extension of lower arm

* Option 1: as shown in class
* Option 2: there is one coming up in the modifications day of the class.

## Cliffhanger
This one starts with hard extension. This is because this pose is intense, and if you teach the option on your knees,
according to Lucas, people will stay there. That's a great version, but it quickly becomes more resting. 

* Option 1: prone (on stomach)
  * Move to where crown of head is touching wall
  * Reach up with both arms
  * Fingers wide
  * Arms wider than shoulders
  * NOTE: elbow creases are UP, UP, UP, - do not rotate either way, may stress elbow joint
    * If you feel stress in your elbow joints, go wider with your hands
* Option 2: Shins on ground, mat width apart
  * Use forearm as distance for knees (I found this too close, moved back a bit)
  * Reach up wall, fingers wide
  * Arms wider than shoulders

## Lightning Bolt
* Option 1: sitting on shins
  * Knees together
  * Put enough blocks/pillows under bum
  * Feet wide enough so that fingers fit between foot and bum
  * Feet outside of hips
* Option .5: For injuries
  * Sit on chair
  * Feet plantar flexed (pointing) and under your
  * Tops of toes touching ground
  * Real potential for negative talk - stop it

Work from where you are.
