title: SoS for Tai Chi Post Notes Days 1, 2
description: "Collecting notes from first two days, focusing on Accessible and working way lower, remember, feel, and noodle, I personally find doing several of the poses in another option improve the pose, when I don't this, it's my ego 'OH, look how stretchy I am' - doesn't help."

## General
* Good: start accessible and go to less
* Good: option/not level!!
* Good: feel not look
* Consider: Low WIP, don't give all notes every time

## Moon Squats
* Stand up, hands up, look up (optional affirmation) "Smile, things are looking up!"
* Squat down, down, down 
* Squeeze your fists
* Rest your forehead on your wrists
* Inhale up
* Exhale Down

Possible Progression
* Start on your mats, feet hip width or a bit more apart, feet turned out a bit, 10ish degrees (show with hands)
* Inhale as you reach up
* Exhale as you squat down, down, down
* Inhale, reach up, spread your fingers
* Exhale, down, squeeze your fists, cross your wrists
* Inhale as you read up, spread your fingers, look up (and smile)
* Exhale down, grip your fists, cross your wrists, head into your writs
* Etc. Mix it up, not all queues - too much for people to concentrate on

## Blaster
* Start in a tabletop position, hand below your shoulders, knees bent, feet flat
* Curl your toes, push up into something like a down dog, we won't be here long
* Take your right leg, swing it around to your right foot.
* Use your hand to sneak your foot forward, sneak, sneak. You want your foot a little bit ahead of your hand
* Turn your right foot out a touch, 10, 20 degrees, don't lose connection with the ball of your foot behind your big toe
* Point your back / left foot (plantar) and slide your left leg back
* Melt into your mat as you relax your hips apart

* Grab a chair/blocks put them in front of you
* Get into pose (as above)
* Start with your forearms on the bench, hands up, and relax into the pose
* Option, maybe turn the bench, go to blocks
* Option, go onto your forearms
* Option (my go to), put a thick pillow under your back leg for a little support
* Remember, wet noodle, even if you can "go deeper," it could make the pose less effective. If you are pushing too hard, you'll be confusing your nervous system
* Option (how I started), when starting this pose, big pile of blankets under your chest

* Variation from last class: start from down dog versus tabletop

* Front, bent leg, flexion
* Back, extended leg, toes pointed, extension

* To get out of this pose
  * Option, curl under your back foot, push with it to help bring your front leg back
  * Option, put your front had under your knee, and rest your kneed on your elbow, then use this to slide your leg back

## Butterfly
* Start with a pillow under your butt
* Put a bench, table, coffee table, in front of you (OK, move to the coffee table, this isn't resistance training)
* Connect the bottoms of your feet in front of you
* Make this wide, three to four fists from your pelvis to your heals
* Lean forward, using a bench to control how far
* It's great to put a block, pillow, under your butt, you want to lean forward
* It's ok to curl your back, but make sure you do not feel it in your lower back
  * If you notice pinching in your lower back, block head (get a few blocks, put them under your forehead/chin & rest)
