## What Is This

I have managed to grow mushrooms in a home with 5 cats and a dog. Mostly reliably.
This will document my conglomeration of what I've read, what I remember from high 
school science, and other wild guesses that might help, but probably won't hurt.

I'm going to include links to actual things I have purchased, so you can more easily 
replicate what I've done. Get what works for you. 

After Part 1, the subsequent sections will appear live as I reapply what I'm writing,
and including pictures.

## As Summarized as I Dare

This whole process takes between 12 and 7 weeks.
* Get spores
* Prepare growth medium 
* Prepare jars for medium
* Sterilize medium in jars
* Inoculate jars
* Wait 3 - 6 weeks
* Prepare bulk substrate 
* Mix medium into substrate
* Wait 2 - 3 weeks
* Fruit
* Enjoy

What remains is a quick summary of each step. I hope it's a quick enough
to get the gist, as well as enough to know whether it's something you might 
give a try.

## Get Spores

This documents what I've done around early 2022 with Lion's Mane. These steps are 
fairly universal, so Lion's Mane is just a start.

### What You Need
* I recommend [Premium Spores Lion's Mane](https://premiumspores.com/product/lions-mane-liquid-culture/).
  This company is reliable, responsive to email, and quick.
* Ability to make a Zelle, or several other non-credit-card-based payments
* Somewhat fine motor control to use a syringe
* Ability to place order online (phone may be possible, as is regular USPS)

### Time
Approximate time 1 week to place an order and get it.

If you are not ready to start, you can store for months in a cool dark place, or even loner 
in the refrigerator.

## Prepare Growth Medium

There are many choices, but my current choice is hard red wheat berries.

### What You Need
* [Palouse Brand Hard Red Wheat Berries](https://www.palousebrand.com/collections/hard-red-winter/products/hard-red-winter-wheat-berries-5-lb?variant=40135474053173).
* a pot to hold the wheat berries
* gypsum (optional)
* coffee grounds (optional)
* stove
* pasta strainer
* slightly more than ability-to-boil-water-on-the-stove-level cooking skills

### Time
1 day of mostly waiting.

## Prepare Jars for Medium

We'll be using 8 oz mason jars, but larger is fine. You'll be using a hammer
and a nail to punch holes in a lid, and then placing filers over those holes.

### What You Need
* [Mason jars with lids](https://www.target.com/p/ball-set-of-12-half-pint-8-oz-quilted-mason-jar/-/A-13562672#lnk=sametab)
* Nail and Hammer
* 8 pieces of cardboard cut into 4 x 4 squares
* [Synthetic Filter Paper Stickers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08T1T8Z78/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Ability to use hammer and nail on a stack of cardboard

### Time
15 - 20 minutes

## Sterilize Jars in Medium

Load each jar to 3/4 full. Cover jar with tin foil. Sterilize in an Insta Pot. A pressure
cooker is fine.

### What You Need
* Tin foil
* Insta Pot 
* Wire rack to keep jars off bottom

### Time
7 hours, mostly waiting
* 30 minutes prep
* 60 minutes (check notes) for 8 oz. jars
* 90 minutes (check notes) or 32 oz. jars
* 4 hours to cool slowly

## Inoculate jars

This is where things can start to go wrong. I have built a still air box for about $40, 
use 99% isopropyl alcohol, and I also use a strong uvc light.

You place the spores and sterilized jars in the still air box, spray the inside of the 
box with 99% alcohol, use a UVC light, then put the spore in the jars.

### What you need
* Still Air Box (see below)
* [99% isopropyl alcohol](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J62C1K5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Professional Spray Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G6EMOKW/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&aaxitk=e42b069387e3f02acb3ab11ed1951a2a&hsa_cr_id=3580719100001&pd_rd_plhdr=t&pd_rd_r=67a687f2-8936-4bb0-a6f1-3357092cfbb6&pd_rd_w=Dp6Po&pd_rd_wg=DFroV&ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_lsi4d_asin_0_title)
* [UVC Light](https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/high-power-60w-uv-c-room-sterilizing-kit.aspx)

#### Build a Still Air Box
* Large clear plastic storage container
* [Still Air Box Port Kit](https://www.etsy.com/listing/900290105/still-air-glove-box-port-kit-sab?click_key=dbca0bb61458ff69a91c975db46fd77171d5f915%3A900290105&click_sum=b336ae09&ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=still+air+box&ref=sr_gallery-1-10&col=1&sts=1)
* Drill
* 4.5" hole saw (4.25" in my case, and a Dremel to extend)
* 8 pieces of 6"x6" cardboard
* Ability to use said drill

### Time
* 1 hour to build the still air box (1 time only, you'll get a lot of use out of this)
* 1 hour to inoculate the jars, 10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes waiting, 20 minutes inoculating

## Wait 3 - 6 Weeks

You want to leave the jars in a dark place, at about 78°f, 25.5°c. A cardboard box and
a heating mat with a temperature controller makes this reliable.

### What You Need
* [Seeding Heating Mat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J56XYN6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Cardboard box
* Room/closet with moderate temperature around 72°f, 22°c - 76°f, 24°c
* Towel or small shelf so jars do not touch heating mat

## Prepare bulk substrate

There are several mixes, and I recommend having a look at [kinoko cultures](https://www.kinokocultures.com/kinoko-cultures-blog/culture-substrate-recipes).
For this journey, we'll be using coconut coir and vermiculite. That is a mix you can pasteurize, making
it a bit easier to work with.

### What You Need
* [Coconut Coir](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086PZLD5W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Vermiculite](https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/Vermiculite)
* [Scale](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LXXBQWD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* 1 Gallon Bucket
* Rice Spoon Stirring Stick
* Coffee Grounds (Optional)
* Gypsum (optional)
* [Oven Thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017613C3C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Synthetic Filter Paper Stickers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08T1T8Z78/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Foil Pans](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N6NBTB6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* (Optional) Bamboo from your back-yard

### Time
About 8 hours, mostly waiting
* 15 minutes mixing  
* 3 hours pasteurization
* 4 hours to cool

## Mix Medium Into Substrate

Back to the dry air box where you will mix the mycelium-covered grain into the bulk substrate.
This is another place where things can go wrong, but you'll be using some familiar equipment.

### What You Need
* Dry Air Box
* 99% Isopropyl Alcohol
* UVC Light

### Time
30 Minutes

## Wait 2 - 3 weeks

Let this container hang out for 2 - 3 weeks in the same place the grain was sitting.

### What You Need
Patience

### Time
2 - 3 Weeks

## Fruit

You'll put your turkey container of sprouting mushrooms into a fruiting chamber, which you'll
build. And now the manual stuff really starts.

### What You Need
* Fruiting Chamber (another plastic box you can build)
* Heating Mat
* [Perlite](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S4FTPYB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Distilled Water
* [Spray Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WQTP669/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* (Optional)[Inline Duct Fan with Carbon Filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B3RNW35/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* 4" duct for the fan

### Time
2 - 3 more weeks

## Enjoy
You'll have mushrooms if all has gone well. Pick and eat fresh. Or dry.
