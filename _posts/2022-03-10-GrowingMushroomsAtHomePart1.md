## What Is This

I have managed to grow mushrooms in a home with 5 cats and a dog. Mostly reliably.
I'm going to walk you through my current process, all of which is my conglomeration 
of what I've read, what I remember from high school science, and other wild guesses
that might help, but probably won't hurt.

I'm going to include links to actual things I have purchased, so you can more easily 
replicate what I've done. Get what works for you. 

## PK Tek, Grain Spawn, Bulk Substrate, Fruiting ...???

In a nutshell:
* Get some spores to grow (live spores in this case - but same steps for spores). 
  This documents the process for  
* Prepare 32 oz. glass jars with filters
  [Premium Spores Lion's Mane](https://premiumspores.com/product/lions-mane-liquid-culture/))
* Prepare and Sterilize [Palouse Brand Hard Red Wheat Berries](https://www.palousebrand.com/collections/hard-red-winter/products/hard-red-winter-wheat-berries-5-lb?variant=40135474053173)
  in 32 oz. glass jars
* Inoculate those jars the spores in a home-grown dry air box
* Wait in darkness at about 78 f, 2.5 c, for 3 - 6 weeks
* Prepare bulk substrate (pasteurized coir/vermiculite/gypsum/coffee grounds), and recently optionally 
  added bamboo I grew, dried naturally, and then water pastured (skip the bamboo unless you have 
  a lot of time on your hands)
* Combine inoculated wheat berries and bulk substrate in a clean-ish environment
* Wait a few weeks
* Open up to air and put in home-built high humidity chamber
* Several times a day, open up chamber and give it fresh air, and a mist of distilled water
  (again, helps to be home all the time)
* About 10-15 days you'll see growth
* Shortly thereafter, you'll have mushrooms
