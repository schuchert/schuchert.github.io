## Pose Options
Remember, when we are working on deep flexibility, going deeper might actually reduce the effectiveness of a pose.
Your target is 7/10 if you uninjured. How do you know you are 7/10? A rough suggestion is that if you can communicate
without too much effort, you are not too deep. If you struggle to talk, probably too deep, come back.

In general, start higher up, and work your way lower as you practice pose over multiple sessions.

For example, I use a bench or table for Rag Doll. I can hold the pose with my hands on the floor, but I tend to target
the backs of my legs. To get my shoulders targeted, I can externally rotate my arms, but then my arms are yang,
and the rest of my body is yin, I'm confusing my nervous systems.

A key idea: It's how it feels, now how it looks. Going deeper is often exactly what you do not what to do.
