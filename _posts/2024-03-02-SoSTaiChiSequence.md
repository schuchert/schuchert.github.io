## Pose Options
Remember, when we are working on deep flexibility, going deeper might actually reduce the effectiveness of a pose.
Your target is 7/10 if you uninjured. How do you know you are 7/10? A rough suggestion is that if you can communicate
without too much effort, you are not too deep. If you struggle to talk, probably too deep, come back.

In general, start higher up, and work your way lower as you practice pose over multiple sessions.

For example, I use a bench or table for Rag Doll. I can hold the pose with my hands on the floor, but I tend to target
the backs of my legs. To get my shoulders targeted, I can externally rotate my arms, but then my arms are yang,
and the rest of my body is yin, I'm confusing my nervous systems.

A key idea: It's how it feels, now how it looks. Going deeper is often exactly what you do not what to do.

### Rag Doll
This is targeting the back of your spine, and it may target the back of you legs. If you feel any pain in your lower
back, bend your knees. Regardless, keep your knees bent.

* Option: Bench/chair/coffee table/couch to support your arms
* Option: Place your hands on blocks
* Option: Use a wall, place your bum on the wall

### Cliffhanger
This is an intense pose targeting your shoulders and thoracic spine extension.

* Option: Kneeling next to a wall, fingertips just touching the wall, place your hands up the wall and fall in to your shoulders and spine

### Noodle

and get a nice gentle arch in your back. Adjust to avoid pinching in your lower back.

* Option: Use the arm of a couch, again several pillows
* Option: Blocks under your back with several pillows

### Hero / Lightning Bold

* Option: Bum on floor, reach arms behind you, lower to your elbows
* Option: Bum on floor, leann back onto your elbows, using a pillow on your back

### Twister
An asymmetrical passive twist, to really release your lower back.

* Option: Legs crossed, as many pillows as you need to relax
* Option: Legs all the way to the ground
