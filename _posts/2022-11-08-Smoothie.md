## Overview

I'm a caregiver, and I have a day job. This includes meals. One daily meal is a smoothie. 
This is something that has morphed over 2 years, and while it can always be improved, there
are a number of things in there that make it complete.

## The Ingredients

This is both the list of ingredients and the order in which I put them in the blender. The basic idea is:
liquid, banana (because it floats), then powders, then frozen stuff at the top. All amounts are made up 
because they are expected in a recipe. Adjust for flavor, and consistency. 

* Liquid, 1 cup / 237 ml. liquid, e.g., [V8 Pomegranate Blueberry](https://www.campbells.com/v8/products/v8-blends/pomegranate-blueberry-blends/)
* Banana, 1, broken into several pieces
* Gelatin, 1 - 3 tsp. / 5 - 15 grams, e.g., (Beef Gelatin)[https://greatlakeswellness.com/products/beef-gelatin-single-can]
* Mushroom mix, 1 - 2 tsp. / 5 - 10 grams:
  * [Lion's Mane](https://shop.realmushrooms.com/collections/bulk-organic-mushroom-extract-powders/products/organic-lions-mane-mushroom-powder-supplement)

  * All bags throws into a mason jar and mixed.

* Ice cubes, 3 - 6
* Frozen Blueberries, 1/2 - 1 cup / 118 - 237 ml

Blend for several minutes. Add additional water to thin if needed.
