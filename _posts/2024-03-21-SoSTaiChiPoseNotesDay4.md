## Pigeon
Asymmetrical pose, so 3 minutes means it'll take 6 in a class.

Setting up:
* Stack of pillows
* Bench in front
* put knees on pillow
* (right side) Reach your right leg around to the front.
* Slide your right foot to the left side of your mad
* Set your knee down. Parallel with front of mat OK, but make sure knee is turned out a bit
* Right bum on pillows
* Extend left leg back, toes pointed / plantar flexion
* Hands on bench

Options
* Pillows and bench
* Remove pillows 
* Remove bench when you can hold it by putting arms on front leg, knee/ankle

## Plough
Demonstrate this pose and then guide. Why?
* Your voice will be strained
* You might be tempted to turn your neck and look at camera **do not twist your neck in this pose**

Setting Up:
* Bench at top of mat
* Lie on your back (supine), head close to bench (about an arm length? check, I was too close, my shins were on bench today)
* Arms at your side, hands near hips
* Lift your hips
* Place palms on your hip, lock elbows map
* Lift your legs until they are pointing to the sky (plantar flexion ankles)
* Continue with your legs, over your head, until they rest on the bench
* Keep your hands on your hips until you are fully over
* Rest your palms back on the ground

Getting out:
* Press with you hands
* Lift your legs up
* As you come to toes pointing to the sky, use your forearms to support you, engage your core
* Articulate your spine, one vertebra at a time
* Feet on ground, relax

Lie on your back,
* Option 1: stool w/pillows
* Option 2: legs hanging
* Option 3: feet on ground - nothing special happens here
