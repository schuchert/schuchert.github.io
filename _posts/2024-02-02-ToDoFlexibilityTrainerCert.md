## Review 12 YB Chapters

### Each has 3 poses

* Name/Review Each
* Handwrite Each
* Identify which of these address poses in training manual poses

* ### Each has technical notes
* Capture/review terms
* Capture/review body parts
* Review mnemonics & physical mnemonics
* Verbally practice guiding each of the practice poses

## Practical Exam

Create a 1-hour program, try it out yourself, record yourself leading someone through it (not full length for holds)

### #Qigong Flow Flexibility

This is the contents of the practical exam I believe.

* Create Program (see below)
* Fully practice my routine (done whole thing, not full time)
* Record version with someone in February
* Get pictures of self in poses for pose summary chart similar to happy hips
* (stretch) offer it as a class locally or online

#### The Plan - move to sub page

This is a mix of #Qigong and Science of Stretching poses that generally prepares you to practice a moving form
like #TaiChi, as well as other internal martial arts.

This entire practice will engage the body, dynamically and statically twist the torso, and generally prepare for
a final in-place moving meditation to attempt to root the hips to the ground, and the upper body to the pelvic
floor.

During the closing practice, part of the guidance will help the students to hone their sense of interoception,
specifically:

* the relationship between tucking the tailbone and the engagement of the heals
* where in the body is the student feels while pushing their fontanel away from their perineum
* the sensation around the inner-shoulders, armpits when using turtle back or medial rotation of the arms
* the circular pattern of feet, knees, hips, fontanel, medial rotation, spinal column/pelvic floor lock in / Rooting.
