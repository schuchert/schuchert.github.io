# Assumptions

I'm assuming you've come to this with a basic understanding of The Wheel of Life. If not, I suggest reading
[Awakening from the Daydeam, by David Nichtern](https://a.co/d/b9oZRqe). This also assumes you have read a bit
from [Joy of Agility, by Joshua Kerievsky](https://a.co/d/ibE3zIX).

# Overview

I happened to start reading [Awakening from the Daydeam, by David Nichtern](https://a.co/d/b9oZRqe) shortly before
[Joy of Agility, by Joshua Kerievsky](https://a.co/d/ibE3zIX). 

In David's book, he uses The Wheel of Life model, but rather than applying it to reincarnation, he applies the 
ideas to psychological states. In his approach, he suggests that each of the 6 realms can be thought of as states
of being. If you can recognize these states of being, you can then use thousands of years of wisdom to figure out
ways of changing your psychological state, and reducing your suffering. 

In Joshua's book, he talks about 6 Mantras, or ways of being. If you are in that mode, you are more likely to
move with Quick and Easy Grace. If you are not following these mantras, you might be in the opposite psychological
state. Joshua uses stories to illustrate ways to BE in the way of the 6 mantras (my framing).

Upon making this connection, I wondered if we could map the 6 mantras to the 6 realms. If we can do that, then
you can use both Joshua's catalog of stories and allegories, and you can also look at techniques from Buddhism. 
This gives us more tools to be agile, be present, be happier, and reduce suffering.

As I write the above, I have not yet made the connection. So let's see where this goes.

## Six Realms
* Heavenly
* Demi-God
* Human
* Animal
* Ghosts
* Hellish

## Six Mantras
* Be quick, don't hurry 
* Be balanced, and graceful
* Be poised to adapt
* Start minimal, and evolve
* Drive out fear
* Be ready and resourceful
