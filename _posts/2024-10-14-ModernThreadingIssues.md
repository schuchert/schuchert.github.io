## Background
A few decades ago I contributed two chapters to Clean Code, both on Threading. There's an upcoming second edition of 
that book for its 15th Anniversary, and it brought that subject to my mind. I have not directly worked on multithreaded 
code in well over a decade. However, many of the problems and issues still exist in modern systems, even ones that 
handle "all the multi-user stuff" for you.

## Problems
There are a number of issues to keep in mind when dealing with threaded implementations:
* [Data Integrity](#recent-data-integrity-issues)
* [Deadlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock_(computer_science))
* [Livelock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock_(computer_science)#Livelock)
* [Starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science))

We'll focus on data integrity here. The other three are well addressed by understanding a few fundamental algorithms:
* [Producers / Consumers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem)
* [Readers / Writers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writers_problem)
* [Dining Philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem)

These three algorithms capture most situations that you're likely to encounter, as mentioned in the first edition
of Clean Code.

## Recent Data Integrity Issues
In the past few years we've come across a number of situations where a multi-user system had potential data integrity
issues. All of these systems have multiple simultaneous users (parallel), doing something that updates shared
data. 

These examples come from two different multi-user systems based in React-Native. They use AWS Lambdas for 
a back-end, and storage in some data store. There's nothing inherently problematic with these kinds of system. If two 
users do not share data, then there are likely no data integrity issues. However, what happens when multiple users do 
depend on shared data?

The examples are:
* {% include li-link title="Joining a Game" %}
* {% include li-link title="Working on a shared Design" %}
* {% include li-link title="Players working in parallel to create a deck of cards" %}
* {% include li-link title="Double deleting of resources on re-render using a 2D Library in React-Native" %}
* {% include li-link title="Loading Icon Resources" %}

### Joining a Game
Imagine mobile-games platform used for training workshops. Students log into a game. One game had a limit of 6 players, 
so after the 6th player joins, subsequent attempts to join the game are rejected. Each player is assigned a role, 
numbered 1 - 6.

The back-end system uses DynamoDb, which gives eventually consistent results.

For a number of months we've had an occasional kerfuffle where it seems we were losing players. It turned out to 
be an issue with when we decided to assign player roles, as well as even having players immediately join a game. 
In the original implementation, we combined logging in, with joining a game, and assigning roles to players. 
Assigning players to games and roles, along with eventual consistency in DynamoDB, lead to users getting the same 
roles, or games overfilling.

While it was possible to rewrite how we interacted with DynamoDB, there was another desired change that predated 
discovering this defect. That change would make the original problem disappear by separating logging in with joining 
a game, and subsequent role assignment.

The original issue was assigning roles to multiple users joining a game from multiple mobile clients, that is, in
parallel. To fix this, we first we expanded the domain. Rather than players joining a game at login time, Players 
join a waiting room. Later, the administrator creates games and then issues a request to assign all waiting players to 
games.

This took something that was not safe without transaction isolation, both joining a game, and role assignment, from
being executed potentially in parallel, to being executed later from a single thread / issued by a single user. The
original implementation was not an essential part of how we wanted the game to work, it was one of the first ideas
on how to handle multiple games going on at the same time.

One of the side effects of that approach was that the administrator would create games ahead of time, and then tell
specific people to log into specific games. Users would enter their name, a game name, and a game password. It was 
common for communication issues, causing people to join the wrong game.

After the change, all Players join a waiting room, the name of which is the administrator's email address, provided 
in a pull-down list. So rather than game name, username, password, players selected a waiting room name, and 
provided their name.

This separated the multi-thread-safe part of the work, getting into the system, from the not multi-thread-safe part 
of the work, joining a specific game, and assigning user roles. 

### Working on a shared Design
Next up, a system allowing the shared-creation of a design for the installation/updating of a commercial security 
system. For this system, we used a Relational Database.

Such a plan has dozens of images, each image might have several elements, that might be connected. How do you make sure 
that multiple people can work on the same design at the same time, without conflict?

For this particular domain, the number of users on a design is generally under 5, and the users tend to work on
different parts of an overall design. So while the possibility of conflict was there, given the typical use of 
the system, the likelihood of it happening was small.

Pre-existing in the system was the need to select an Element to edit it. This became a natural place to lock 
an element. We use a flag on the element for whether it is locked. Any attempt to lock when already locked fails and 
informs the user that the element is locked. Upon deselection, the element's lock is released. We chose a flag
on an element, rather than locking the element in the database, because the latter would require long-lived 
transactions. 

With proper transaction isolation, this is a clean, safe solution to the particular problem.

### Players working in parallel to create a deck of cards
This is an example of an anti-case, we chose to not solve the problem. Imagine a second mobile-game which allows 
small groups of players to compete in creating a deck of cards with certain characteristics. 

In this case, we have up to 4 people creating a deck of cards. Those players might be remote, local, colocated, or not. 
What happens if 2 players create the same card?

Players attempt to create a deck with certain characteristics. If they happen to get duplicate cards, the instructor
rejects their deck. However, when this happens, the team can clean up their deck and resubmit it. Also, that kind
of thing happening can lead to good discussions about collaboration and communication, so trying to make sure it
doesn't happen reduces the value of the experience.

In this case, there's a shared resource, the deck of cards. The addition of cards is done in parallel. There can
be a "data integrity" issue, duplicated work, but the end result is easy to recover from, all done through human 
interaction.

Early on we realized this was a potential issue. When we thought through solutions, we decided to leave the potential
in the game. An instructor can run the game in different ways, with different rules. So in this case, the solution
wsa to leave it as is.

### Double deleting of resources on re-render using a 2D Library in React-Native
We were using React-Native, with React-Native-Web, to produce a web and mobile application for a customer. We 
additionally used a 2D Graphics Library called Skia.

Skia is a powerful library, and it has its own rendering engine. This means there are at least two rendering 
engines running at the same time: React-Native, and Skia, and those two rendering engines are not synchronized. 
We did not notice an issue until we added asynchronous loading of designs.

When a user opens a design, we load it asynchronously while moving into the design view of the application. When 
we started doing this, we found that Skia was frequently crashing.

What ultimately caused this was rendering the Skia view before we had finished loading. In React-native,
this is normal. It re-renders the view. However, since Skia has its own rendering thread, when React-Native
re-rendered the view at an unexpected time, Skia would start to delete, then re-delete the same resources. 
Deleting already-deleted memory killed Skia and required restarting the application. This wasn't an issue with 
Skia, it was how we were using it.

The solution for this was to not render the Skia view until loading was done. We had well-defined locations where 
we needed Skia to be rending and where it was not required. We make sure to:
* Only render the Skia view when loading was complete, otherwise render an empty view
* Any time we issued a change that caused a re-render of the skia view, we first cleared a setting, which would cause the Skia view to stop being rendered
* Then we'd set a new value, causing everything to be rendered fresh

The end solution resulted in cleaner code overall. The solution was to allow for "parallel" rendering threads only
when a design was loaded. No design? No Skia rendering. Design? Skia rendering. Any time we changed designs, we
first set state to stop rendering Skia, loaded the design, and upon completion, begin using Skia again.

### Loading Icon Resources
We had an issue with the order in which icons were loaded. It was possible to load a design into the system before the 
code to load the icons had started executing. When this happened, we'd have to re-load the design, or have several 
missing icons.

Since the resources were needed by other parts of the system, we moved them into a so-called provider in React-Native.
Then, any code that might cause a design to be loading always executed under that provider, that is, there was a 
parent-child relationship between the provider and anything using Icons. The parent initializes first, guaranteeing
the order of execution.

As with the previous example, this resulted in cleaner code. Things that were related moved closer together under
a single place, and we removed duplication.

## Sharing Data
In all of these examples, there's some issue with sharing data:

* Allowing players to join a specific game, and get a role assigned in parallel, with an eventually consistent database
* Allowing editing of a shared design, by multiple users in parallel
* Allowing players to create cards in parallel
* Multiple, dependent rendering loops that are not coordinated, with other asynchronous activity impacting them
* Not controlling the execution / loading of resources explicitly in an asynchronous environment

We took different approaches for each of these problems:
* Isolate the non thread-safe code and execute it later in a single thread - isolate and separate
* Locking objects with a flag, using a relational database
* Do nothing, a human can choose to reject or accept based on the current rules of the game
* Avoid using the second rendering thread until it's actually needed, and clear it before clearing everything else
* Make the loading part of a parent-child relationship, such that the child doesn't render until the parent is ready

Once you've discovered an issue with shared data, there are many approaches you might take to address it. We've seen
5 examples and 5 different approaches to specific problems. Are there any examples you've come across?
