## A stream of thoughts

I'm re-reading [Are Your Lights On, Gause & Weinberg](https://leanpub.com/areyourlightson). The first time I read 
this book was around the turn of the century. I am a different person, both figuratively and literally, so while the 
book hasn't changed, I'm seeing much more than I did the first time.

For example, this quote:
> The really important thing in dealing with problems is to know that the question is never answered, but that 
> it doesn't matter, as long as you keep asking.

The first thing that came to my mind was "Perfection is a Journey, not a Destination." That's a motto I picked up in 
the early days of my yoga practice. I read this book before I started practicing yoga, so I would not have thought 
that the first time I read the book.

Another way to phrase that might be: Perfection is a process, not an event.

This seems to tie to some of my older opinions around [Plato's Theory of Formns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms),
which I summarily reject. It seems if I reject Plato's Theory of Forms, then I'd say that perfection as a thing also
does not exist. Perfection is a perceived characteristic of something from an observer. So perfection is a
relationship between things rather than a stand-along thing itself.

Next, I jumped over to Lean thinking. In Lean, Muda (waste) is everywhere. It's safe to say that there's always 90% Muda
in every process you follow. Once you have removed 90% of that waste, 90% of what is left over remains waste. It's waste 
all the way down, not [turtles](https://apilgriminnarnia.com/2014/03/26/turtles/), as I was lead to believe.

So what's the connection then?

* G & W suggest that you will never know that a question is answered, but keep asking, it's a process, a journey, you 
  really don't know the actual destination, or if you ever reached it, but keep trying until the problem is no longer 
  perceived as a problem.
* Perfection, in yoga, problem definition, or software, is a journey, not a destination. If you want even more, 
  give [Perfect Software, by Weinberg](https://leanpub.com/perfectsoftware) a read.
* Muda is the reflection of perfection. Since perfection is a journey, so too is muda. Additionally, much like you 
  never know if the question is answered, you can also never remove all waste. 
  Muda removal is a way of being, not a goal.

As I was reviewing this, how I used to define software design came back to me:
> Software design is the art of selecting the solution that sucks the least.

This tongue-in-cheek definition of design expresses a deeper truth. Design is the act of balancing constraints, with a 
few added challenges:
* You don't know all the things you need to balance
* Of the things you are aware of, you probably don't know them well enough either
* The actual cost of a decision will likely never be known accurately, but you need to keep trying...

Sound familiar? Seems like I was pre-destined to read this book. I know that the definition I used for design
pre-dates reading the book because I started using it around 1992.

My modern take? "Best Practice," is a sub-category of perfection.

Finally, like quality, perfection is a relationship. What's perfect for you, isn't perfect for anybody else. In fact,
how you define both the word, and any experience you'd state as perfect, is entirely personal. So, while you can say
that you "know" I fully understand your problem, you cannot know what I understand, so you cannot in fact know you know
I know your problem. 

You could argue, but we can talk to confirm we have the same understanding...

Around 1991 I was taking a philosophy class where we analyzed Descartes' "proof" of the existence of God. In my 
recollection, that argument hinges on something I flat out reject, "perfect" as a shard idea. The word is shared,
but what any two people consider an example of it are probably different. Even if they appear to be the same, the
interpretation of the relationship of perfection requires an understanding of the target of the relationship. The chance
that the internal models of the target by two interpreters are in fact the same, is impossible to prove, and likely
different in any case. 

Note that for most interactions, subtle, and even large differences in internal mental models can manifest as equal, 
but when we try to extend different models to an absolute, such as perfection, even minor differences will show.

In a sense, the first time I read the book, my lights were off. Now that I'm reading the book again so many years later,
are my lights finally on?

Nope. The idea that might lights are on is an example of journey, versus a destination. So, while my lights will
never actually be on, I'm going to keep trying. I assume once I stop doing that, I start to die?
