## There's no organization, mostly a stream of consciousness (or maybe unconsciousness)
I'm working with some tech leads to guide them to learn about coaching their teams themselves. As a part of this,
we are holding book clubs on several books. Right now we are reading [Are Your Lights On, Gause & Weinberg](https://leanpub.com/areyourlightson).

The first time I read this book was around the turn of the century. I am a different person, both figuratively and 
literally and so while the book hasn't changed, I'm seeing much more than I did the first time.

For example, this quote:
> The really important thing in dealing with problems is to know that the question is never answered, but that 
> it doesn't matter, as long as you keep asking.

The first thing I thought was: "Perfection is a Journey, not a Destination." That's a motto I picked up in the early
days of my yoga practice. I read this book before I started practicing yoga, so I would not have thought that the first 
time I read the book.

Another way to phrase that might be: Perfection is a process, not an event. 

This seems to tie to some of my older opinions around [Plato's Theory of Formns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms),
which I summarily reject. It seems if I reject Plato's Theory of Forms, then I'd say that perfection cannot exist either.
Perfection is a perceived characteristic of something from an observer. So it seems that perfection is a
relationship between someone and something.

Next, I jumped over to Lean thinking. In Lean, Muda (waste) is everywhere. It's safe to say that there's always 90% Muda
in every process you follow. Once you have removed 90% of that waste, 90% of what is left over is waste. It's waste all 
the way down, not [turtles](https://apilgriminnarnia.com/2014/03/26/turtles/), as I was lead to believe.

So what's the connection then?

* G & W suggest that you will never know that a question is answered, but keep asking, it's a process, a journey, you 
  really don't know the actual destination, or if you ever reached it, but keep trying until the problem is no longer 
  perceived as a problem.
* Perfection, in yoga, problem definition, or software, is a journey, not a destination. If you want even more, 
  give [Perfect Software, by Weinberg](https://leanpub.com/perfectsoftware) a read.
* Muda is the opposite of perfection. If perfection is a journey, seems like muda removal is as well. And much like 
  you never know if the question is answered, you can also assume all waste is never removed. That is, removing
  muda is a journey, not a destination. Muda removal is a way of being, not a goal. It's a process, not an event.
  
Finally, like quality, perfection is a relationship. What's perfect for you, isn't perfect for anybody else. In fact,
how you define both the word, and any experience you'd state as perfect, is entirely personal. So, while you can say
I fully understand your problem, you cannot know what I understand, so you cannot in fact know you know I know your
problem. 

Around 1991 I was taking a philosophy class where we analyzed Descartes' "proof" of the existence of God. In my 
recollection, that argument hinges on something I flat out reject, "perfect" as a shard idea. The word is shared,
but what any two people consider an example of it are probably different. Even if they appear to be the same, the
interpretation of the relationship of perfection requires an understanding of the target of the relationship. The chance
that the internal models of the target by two interpreters are in fact the same, is impossible to prove, and likely
different in any case. 

Note that for most interactions, subtle, and even large differences in models can manifest as equal. But when we try to
map different models to an absolute, such as perfection, even minor differences will show.

Oh, and as a final bone to throw, to me, "best practice," is a sub-category of perfection.
