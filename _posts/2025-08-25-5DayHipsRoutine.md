# 5-Day Hips Routine

Note: If you notice you are less flexible on a give side, consider increasing the length of that side's stretch a 1
minute

## Purpose

Use this rotation to balance hip strength and deep flexibility. Each day begins with 1–2 strength exercises, includes
transitions when helpful, and finishes with 2–3 long-hold stretches in the Science of Stretching style.

## 3 + 2 principles for Deep Flexibility

| Principle                           | Description                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wet Noodle                          | relax your entire body when possible. You can also lock out your arms, or use props for balance.                                                 |
| Breathe to Relax                    | 4:8 breathing, helps calm you down, which allows you to sit in discomfort longer.                                                                |
| Passive Tension Over Time           | 2 - 5 minutes. Takes about 2 minutes to get into the stretch. After 5 minutes for most poses, probably better to diversify.                      |
| It's how it feels, not how it looks | Use props, make adjustments. We are looking for a good stretch while doing as little as possible, make adjustments, use pillows and other props. |
| You have to work from where you are | Recent injury? Pull back (keep moving, but work at a 4 - 5 / 10, rather than a 7 / 10).                                                          |
