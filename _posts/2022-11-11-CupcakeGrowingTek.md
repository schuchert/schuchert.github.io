## Overview

Mushrooms grown in bulk substrate form a mycelial network. That network is about
as stable as sod, less dense, and maintains the shape of its container. 

A muffin fits in a small plastic container. 

A muffin-shaped mycelial network, wrapped in a metallic muffin liner, sitting on wet
perlite, inside a closed plastic container, with a lid, and a few holes for air exchange, 
would be fun to give as a gift.

***Forming the mycelium network***
* Inoculated Grain
* Bulk Substrate 
* Muffin Pan
* Metallic Muffin Liners

***Fruiting/Growing***
* Plastic Container 
* Perlite 
* Vermiculte (optional)
