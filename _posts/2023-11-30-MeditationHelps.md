Recently I noticed I was distracted while pairing with my colleague. Just as I jumped over to Slack to check a message, 
it occurred to me I could identify this as “thinking.” 

When I meditate, and notice I'm distracted, this is what I say in my head to acknowledge, and then let that thought 
go, so I can get back to my breath.

I tried this here. I labeled the activity "thinking," and I added breathing from my diaphragm to encourage a 
relaxing effect. It worked. Surprisingly well. I immediately switched back, got back into focus, and managed 
for some time thereafter.
