This full flow is well balanced and scientifically informed. It starts with gentle warmup, progresses through thorough
stretching with transitions, and finishes with mindful integration. It prepares body and mind optimally for Tai Chi and
Bagua practice, promoting injury prevention, joint mobility, and muscle flexibility, with a strong focus on internal
awareness throughout.
